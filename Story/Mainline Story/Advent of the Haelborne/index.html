<p><em>Chronicles of the Aethein, Book I</em>
<em>By RatseerOfRattesse</em></p>
<center>"In the pursuit of great, we failed to do good.” – Viktor, Arcane</center>

<h2 id="prologue-eating-new-people">Prologue: Eating New People<a class="headerlink" href="#prologue-eating-new-people" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p><em>never ask a dysphorium about their dietary habits</em></p>
<p>The Haelborne’s dimension ship was a grand undertaking, an enormous hunk of metallic material forged and shaped into a habitable vessel. Ritual diagrams shone across its hull, granting it the magic to cross between realities. For now, it was docked atop the sky-dome of Kaaldenvale, a reality encompassing just a single planet, doing nothing. For any other fringe interdimensional organization, this would be a massive and wasteful expenditure. But for the Haelborne, it was but one of their silent, thousand-strong fleet, out plundering the cosmos like the others.</p>
<p>This particular mission, however, was quite special. Both in terms of the objective… and who was involved.</p>
<p>Aboard the ship, in one of the lounges, was a fae and a dysphorium.</p>
<p>The fae were the local intelligent species of Kaaldenvale, somewhat resembling the elves of Earth folklore. Unlike those nature spirits, they were built for killing, evolved from highly predatory mammals – they bore such features as retractable cat-like claws, razor-sharp flexible ears, and jagged rows of teeth. This particular fae was a relatively recent recruit to the Haelborne cause, specifically for this mission. He announced himself Limril, and proceeded to blunder his way through various social situations with unasked-for factoids.</p>
<p>The dysphorium were nothing like the fae. A population of thousands scattered across the cosmos, with nowhere to call home, they roamed realities, slaughtering thousands with the power of an unchained soul. There was nothing keeping it from committing mass genocide on a whim, except for a lucrative deal.</p>
<p>This dysphorium was a nightmarish concoction. It had serrated blades incorporated into its limbs. Its face was dominated by a wide, ever-grinning mouth of sharp teeth. Its deep blue-grey hair floated in nonexistent wind, parted by a pair of twisting horns. From the rightmost horn hung an hourglass filled with blood red sand. Its name was Grim.</p>
<p>The two were playing a local board game. Limril was unusually enthused for his nonchalant and apathetic demeanour. Grim was alternately moving pieces and tasting them.</p>
<p>“Damnit,” Limril sighed. “Grim, can you not eat those?”</p>
<p>“I could…” Grim spat a bunch of twisted wooden scraps out of its mouth. “But my contract tells me I have to not eat the people.”</p>
<p>“How is that relevant?”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>“How helpful.”</p>
<p><img alt="The Haelborne ship floats over Kaaldenvale" src="../../../assets/img/illustrations/Prologue-1.png" /></p>
<p>Limril sighed again and swept the board and pieces off the table. He waved his hand, and the board hovered its way across the floor and into a cupboard. Eyes dulling, he snatched a can of soda out of nothingness, popping it open and downing a gulp.</p>
<p>“So,” he said between sips. “You ready for dispatch to Javenshard this week?”</p>
<p>“What-shard?” Grim mumbled, its grin fracturing back to a mildly triumphant smile. “What’s to eat there?”</p>
<p>“Javenshard, Grim. A town. In Haelcrien. And you can’t eat anyone until we get scouting done. And then we have to figure out the arrangement with the Felheils…”</p>
<p>Grim blew a raspberry – which was quite odd looking, because it didn’t have lips, and its tongue looked like a spiked mace made from red flesh.</p>
<p>“Can I go negotiate with those guys? I love eating – I mean EATING new people.”</p>
<p>Limril stared at it.</p>
<p>“Fuck I said it twice. Anyway, why’re we going there?”</p>
<p>“The Fundament Glass, Grim. The reason we recruited you in the first place?”</p>
<p>"Recruited me? No, I think I recruited myself.”</p>
<p>“Of course you do. When you get powerful enough, it just seems like everything happens because you’re around.”</p>
<p>“It does because it’s true. So why are we after a piece of glass?”</p>
<p>“If you keep playing dumb, I am going to report you to management.”</p>
<p>“How many calories is that worth?”</p>
<h2 id="chapter-i-everything-stops">Chapter I: Everything Stops<a class="headerlink" href="#chapter-i-everything-stops" title="Permanent link">#</a></h2>
<p><em>and that's on a literal and thematic level &gt;:D</em></p>
<p>Hello there. Reader, fae, sentient entity, monkey? I’m writing this little tome of misfortunes to… document things. For future reference, in case I… well I don’t know… I was bored.</p>
<p>“What are you writing?” Bia asks from somewhere on the left.</p>
<p>Is it just me or do ‘I don’t know’ and ‘IDK’ have different meanings nowadays? ‘I don’t know’ is something the protagonist says after the comic relief guy asks in a terrified voice, ‘what are we going to do’, or something like that. Then, on the other hand ‘IDK’ is just pure cluelessness. No ominous connotations with that one.</p>
<p>Ah. I went off on a tangent again. I gotta stop doing that.</p>
<p>“Hello?” Bia calls.</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>“Rude! Ari, have you ever considered that maybe the reason you have no frie-”</p>
<p>Loud pen scratching noises! Back to the topic at hand. Which isn’t really a topic. But whatever. Hey, it just occurred to me that anybody who finds this thing mysteriously unattended in another universe would think that top paragraph was the author making a lazy excuse so their perspective character could write in first person. Completely hypothetically. Not everything is sarcasm. Don’t be so cynical!... not that I can talk.</p>
<p>I’m writing this as I walk down a forest path with my sister. You might think this is a terrible idea and I should pay more attention while walking through a spooky scary forest infested with monsters and shit. No, I’m good. As a tier seven in the Gov’nance systems, I’ve gotten a lot of attribute points, twenty-seven of which are in soul. I can multitask way better than a regular fae. Took Bia and I, what, six years? to level this high – we’ve nearly reached tier eight too – and, oh, lemme tell ya, it’s worth it. I can run across the entirety of Javenshard in seconds! And to think people lived before the Governance came along. I mean, there is a lot of people who don’t use it… but those people are just lazy. And missing out.</p>
<p>Bia’s merrily skipping down the trail while still ranting about my social deficits – which I assure you do not exist. Bia’s two years older than me – I’m eighteen – and, contrary to the majority of sibling to sibling relationships, she’s always the one annoying me, not the other way around. I’m simply too dignified to give a shit about low hanging self assurement.</p>
<p>Bia’s real tall,  just over two metres. She has short but impeccably styled purple hair (a hallmark of the family). This is the Hastors’ fae colour palette, so we all of have it – though I wear it better than Bia, of course. Mother has it too, even though she married in – I swear it’s coincidence. I hope we’re not inbred – Father did always say we were descended from royalty and those fuckers are notorious for it. She wore her enchanted combat outfit, consisting of an armoured jacket with silver bands and cargo pants. Our ears stretch out far longer than the average fae, expanding about ninety centimetres to either side (another hallmark of the Hastor line – we’re really, uh, special). Three divots were carved into them from the bottom – ear shape was a feature unique to every fae, but the regs over there haven’t got the length to really be all that unique. Again, we’re special.</p>
<p>Compared to Bia, I’m some sort of gremlin. Height-wise, if that wasn’t clear. I have to assume certain levels of disability in anybody reading this (because it’s probably me).</p>
<p>I’m short for a fae, only one and a bit metres tall. My hair’s longer, styled super weird with a braid and multiple blatant violations of the laws of physics. My ears droop downward a lot. My gear (the non-conjured parts anyway) a parka with selective armour plating, with a red scarf layered over it. Not the most resilient – thank wealth inequality for repair enchantments.</p>
<p>“... and that’s why you suck and the gods hate you.”</p>
<p>I looked up.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>I totally heard everything she said. It’s just funnier to pretend I didn’t.</p>
<p>“Smartass.”</p>
<p>“Better than dumbass,” I grumbled, panning my eyes across the trees. “Speaking of which, you, and this idea.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’ll be fine!” Bia replied, spreading her fingers. “The monsters here aren’t even that high level. They’re only tier… what, thirteen?”
I stare back with glaring intensity.</p>
<p>“And we’re tier seven.”</p>
<p>“Well isn’t that just tragic! But please, shut up and do the scan already.”</p>
<p>Rolling my eyes, I summon a weapon with the snap of a finger. A dagger flickers into existence in my hands. Blade of deep purple crystal, with red trails shimmering throughout, twisting and swirling like hundreds of miniature snakes.</p>

<p>I twirl the dagger in a showy way, before sliding it into a scabbard on my belt. This bad boy had slain a lot of monsters and was one of the first abilities I’d acquired, from back when we first immigrated to Haelcrien and mother still had the heart (and sanity, can’t forget that part) to train me.</p>
<p>From my belt pouch (extradimensional!!!) I take a metal tablet far larger than the pouch itself. I tap the tablet three times with a finger like I had done hundreds before. After a brief moment, lines engrave themselves into the metal, creating a radar interface. A quick scanning animation follows, before dots appear around the area. I tap the closest one.</p>

<p>With a rush of wind, I landed in the middle of a forest clearing, immediately knocking several crienbeasts off their feet. As stressed as I was in this over-ranked area of the forest, the thrill of combat rushed me right into the zone. Brandishing my dagger, I immediately leapt at the nearest monster, the sheer force of the launch tearing the poor thing’s head right off its body. It tumbled about for a few seconds while the rest of its Governance-given energy sapped away and it dissolved into a pile of assorted items. Normally monsters didn’t dissolve so quickly, but I must’ve hit that one too hard.</p>

</details>
<p>The rat-bear hybrids rushed forwards in a wave, claws flashing and teeth gnashing. Rocks and chunks of earth lifted as they ran, the spines across their backs lighting up a soft green as the debris shot forward. That was a neat little ability of theirs – manipulating gravity in a small area around them. Anyway, let’s let the little cuties run around a little more. It gets boring from here.</p>
<p>Within the span of a minute, the entire pack lay dead and disembowelled across the forest floor.</p>

<p>Ooh, aren’t the wafting scents of burnt flesh so nice in the pristine outside air? I know, they really are.</p>
<p>Leaves crunched as I stepped to the nearest body. I tapped a finger to the beast’s temple, brushing the thing’s fur with pleasure – there was loot to come.</p>
<details class="governance" open="open">

<p>I ignored the Governance window and proceeded to tap the other corpses, as Bia did likewise on the other side of the clearing. Windows stacked up rapidly before they consolidating into one.</p>
<details class="governance" open="open">
<summary>Loot 10x [Crienbeast Tier V]?</summary>
</details>
<p>I mentally accepted the prompt, and ten bodies dissolved with a poof, leaving piles of neatly packaged monster parts scattered across the ground. Sheets of leather, bags of fur, bundled claws and spines. From Bia’s position came another poof, quickly followed by a whoop of surprise.</p>
<p>“Hoh!” Bia called from across the clearing. “This guy dropped a core!”</p>
<p>I immediately spun around. In Bia’s hand was what looked like a mangled electrical component, composed of a cube-shaped body and tangles of metal wire. Within the core shone a pulsing multicoloured light. These little things were manifestations of the Governance and were embedded in the bodies of all monsters it spawned. Rarely however, did one come out of the process in a usable state.</p>
<p>I did not see what I just described, however. In Bia’s hands was a pile of shining silver coins.</p>

<p>“Nice.” I shrugged, returning to collecting the other drops. I stuffed them all into a second belt pouch. Claws and fur, despite being too large to fit through the opening, simply shrunk as they approached the pouch before slotting into the dark space inside.</p>

<p>We gathered up the rest of the free money and trekked back into the trees and off to the shallower parts of the woods.</p>
<p>“Woo! What a haul!”  Bia exclaimed excitedly. She snatched a metal tablet out of her own belt pouch, fingers flitting about across its surface in practiced motion, cataloguing our operation today. “Two commissions taken, and a ton of bonus loot. Ari – aye – whaddya say we take a day off tomorrow?”</p>
<p>I just stared silently at the dome of scattered lights in the sky. Sorry Bia, I tune out a lot. This late in the day, the stars cast dim orange light onto the ground, though some of them had turned off entirely.</p>
<p>“Huh? Oh,” I muttered, returning her gaze to the forest in front of her. “It’s almost stardown. We should go faster.”</p>
<p>“Boring,” Bia chimed out, sliding the tablet away and jamming her hands in her pockets in a popping motion. “Nightime’s fun! That’s when all the real spooping monsters come out!”</p>
<p>“Y’know, I have a mild suspicion that that’s definitely not a good thing.”</p>
<p>“You’re no fun. I’m going to leave now, meet you at home later!”</p>
<p>In one movement spanning less than a second, she had completely disappeared from sight. With a blink, I pulled at the energy behind my eyes. A red sigil appeared in my vision, becoming smaller as it mapped itself onto my retreating sister’s back.</p>
<p>“Very funny!” I called. “Get back here!”</p>
<p>There was no response. The sigil became smaller, but I could still see in perfect clarity. Perks of levelling so high.</p>
<p>“Bia!”</p>
<p><img alt="Ari stares at Bia while the latter holds up a drained lesser Governance core. Crienbeast corpses litter the ground." src="../../../assets/img/illustrations/Ch1-1.png" /></p>
<p>“BIA!”</p>
<p>I sighed and continued through the melancholic forest. I walked at a leisurely pace, trying to conjure up some thoughts in my solitude. But my mind was empty. Adamantly content to simply observe the world.</p>
<p>I should stop being poetic.</p>
<p>Nah, fuck that.</p>
<p>Trees stretched into unidentifiable shapes.</p>
<p>Leaves chattered in whispers of forgotten languages.</p>
<p>Birds chirped and called distantly.</p>
<p>The shadows seemed… particularly mocking. Like a really really expressive chandelier.</p>
<p>And then everything stopped.</p>
<p>“What the- “</p>
<p>At first, I thought I’d gone deaf. In a place a tier zero would hear nothing, a tier seven could hear the smallest flickers in the environment, from the crawling of insects across the mildewed surfaces to the dripping of minuscule waters from trees to soft dirt.</p>
<p>But no, it wasn’t me.</p>
<p>Silence rang in an almost tangible wave. Something was wrong, something fundamental. I summoned my dagger, slowly turning on the spot, scanning the trees. Nothing else dared move or make noise as a Presence settled over the forest. I couldn’t distinguish any of its elements. It was a maelstrom of madness, merry and ecstatic with the cold promise of eternal unexistence.</p>
<p>I blinked, expecting another red sigil to appear. Nothing.</p>
<p>There were two explanations for this.</p>
<p>A: Something is nearby. Something far more powerful than myself. More powerful than anything I had ever fought, judging by what I felt in that Presence.</p>
<p>B: I am tripping balls.</p>
<p>My eyes slashed across the trees, picking out anything out of place before spotting it: a faint blur speeding forward. Cracks and groans echoed from its position as if reality strained where it stepped.</p>
<p>It was way too fast for me to run away. At least tier fourty based on that one time I watched skilled adventurers fighting higher-tier monsters in Troltano. I couldn’t match its physical speed, but I had years of combat experience. On pure instinct – without even a thought – an array of translucent blue shields sprang up in front of me, just in time to meet a swarm of metal blades.</p>

<p>I stood there for a few seconds, almost disbelievingly.</p>
<p>It had been so long since I’d seen my own blood.</p>
<p>“Shit…”</p>
<p>It was at this point that poor little Aryon Hastor realized… that she had supremely fucked up.</p>
<p>I glanced up at the monster.</p>
<p>“Shit, shit, shit, shit.”</p>
<p>Eight eyes glowed with bright red glee, arranged in a circle surrounding a gaping jaw of metallic teeth. Dark hair floated in flailing strands, drifting through a nonexistent wind.</p>
<p>Why wasn’t it attacking?</p>
<p>Oh yeah. This would be a supremely comedic moment when it slapped me sixteen metres backwards through seventeen trees.
I should probably… run?</p>
<p>“Nope, nope – NOPE, GOODBYE!” I screamed as I conjured my wings and launched into the sky. “I think I’ll just be going this way now and you’re not gonna get anywhere closer or I don’t damn know what I’ll do MAYBE I SHOULD STOP HYPERVENTILATING AND FUCKING RUN!”</p>
<p>The whistling of wind through metal sounded as black tendrils topped with wicked blades surfaced around me. The entity barrelled upwards, closer, closer, closer and closer. I turned around just long enough for the Governance to analyze the monster. A window appeared in the corner of my vision. It didn’t help – in fact, I was now MORE panicked.</p>

<p>“WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!!!! WHAT ARE YOU??!!!!!!!” I half cried. I flung light blades at the thing, screaming and crying my way upwards. Cackling drifted through the rancid air as a massive metal claw snatched me downwards. Debris detonated from the impact as I was slammed against a tree.
The entity didn’t move it’s main body, instead pushing me up the trunk with the claw attached to its tentacle.</p>
<p>It rattled its way closer, taking its time. Its Presence grew stronger, the layers of reality bending and warping as it slashed forwards, limbs distending with snaps and crackles. Finally, it reached the foot of the tree. Its head snapped upwards, eyes piercing my skull as it concentrated its Presence towards me. This was a technique only known by the most elite of adventurers. No sound could escape my lips.</p>
<p>“Hello there!” the entity cheered happily, like a preschooler with a new toy. “I’m Grim!”</p>
<p>Silence. I physically could not talk – the Presence still screaming in my veins.</p>
<p>“Oh, not up for a talk then? Funny! Straight to the chase then…” Grim’s eye sockets narrowed. It had no pupils, but this still achieved a look of persecution – or, to be less descriptive, a look of ‘I’m going to kill you and everyone you love and then I’m going to steal your tendons to make a blanket.’ “Would you be so kind as to hand over the Firmament Hourglass?”</p>
<p><img alt="Grim pins Ari to a tree with a claw." src="../../../assets/img/illustrations/Ch1-2.png" /></p>
<p>The Presence relaxed slightly.</p>
<p>The Presence relaxed slightly.</p>
<p>The Presence relaxed slightly.</p>
<p>“W-what?” I shuddered, heart pounding through my chest. The trinket under my scarf seemed to become heavier.</p>
<p>Grim’s eyes narrowed further. It sighed and dragged its hand upwards. It had no fingers – the end of its forearm instead hosted three serrated, articulated metal claws. With a movement faster than I could see, it pulled my necklace out from under my scarf. At the end of the chain was that tiny hourglass, filled with blood red sand.</p>
<p>Oh, oh yeah. I definitely know what it wants.</p>
<p>“This little trinket around your neck, of course!”</p>
<p>So, I was stuck in a very bad position. I could be loyal and keep the treasure my clinically insane mother had adamantly told me several thousand times not to lose – or I could save my own life.</p>
<p>Wanna guess which one I went with?</p>
<p>“Uh, no.”</p>
<p>This was a completely rational and logical decision. You can imagine me giving a thumbs up right now.</p>
<p>The Presence returned in an instant, a reality-shattering aura thundering into place. Screams and wails echoed through my ears, the smell of soot and ash burning through my skull like the spilled internal bodily fluids of hundreds of ended lives. Another tentacle, this one topped with a massive scythe, unlatched itself from Grim’s back and ripped into my chest. Frankly, it was a miracle I was still alive. Tier seven blood coursed out of the wound, the vital force keeping her together spilling by the litre.</p>

<p>“Perhaps I was not clear enough?” Grim cackled. “Honestly man, I’m STARVING. Best give me the little thingy or I’ll be forced to – eheheh – have a snack.”</p>
<p>“I have to uh – uh – go somewhere, I have – like, an appointment with my… anarchist!”</p>
<p>Grim raised another claw-hand. It dug further into my ribcage, tossing out various organs before picking up my heart and casually popping it into its mouth.</p>

<p>I had no lungs to scream. No biggie. I’m sure everything will turn out okay. Sarcastic optimism is my coping mechanism!</p>
<p>“Relinquish the hourglass please,” Grim chittered, its tone as goofy as ever. "I need your soul’s permission."</p>
<p>I could only cough and splutter. This, however, was an advanced battle tactic known as DECEPTION, BITCH!</p>
<p>This method is also known as saving your most powerful move until the end of the fight for dramatic effect and definitely not because I’m too much of scaredy cat to manage logical thinking in a near death situation.</p>
<p>I raised a hand in a casting position, pointed at Grim. Four fingers stretched out as far forward as possible, the pinky folded backwards across the bottom of the thumb. There was a moment of silence, as Grim curiously tilted its head. Ooh, it had no idea.</p>
<p>I pulled at the energy under my eyes. Four red circles burned indents into my thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers. I grunted in pain.</p>
<p>Tendrils of piercing red light blasted from my fingers. Crackling erupted at an ear-piercing pitch as the red lightning shot towards Grim and sent the thing flying off hundreds of kilometres into the horizon. Panting, I fell to the ground, clutching the gaping hole in my chest. The flesh had already started to knit back together – thank the Immortals for ranked-up healing kicking in.</p>
<p>Crawling into a comfortable position, I reached into my extradimensional pouch, fumbling about before snatching out a massive bottle. It had an unbalanced top and bottom, almost like one of those kids’ science worksheets we did in first grade.</p>

<p>I ripped off the cork and downed all the silver liquid inside. My wounds healed even faster, flesh and sinew flashing and flailing until it looked like there was never any damage at all. It was half a minute before I moved. Even though it had physically healed me, it wasn’t able to cure exhaustion.</p>
<p>Once the potion had done its job, I shambled upright. Again lifting an arm in casting position, I waved it in a ring and the red energy cut a hole in the world. Through the tear was my bedroom – not that my dreary state could interpret what I was seeing. This entire portal wasn’t even a conscious action. On instinct, I needed my bed. I slouched through the portal, collapsing on the plank floor of the room, before rolling to stare upwards. My vision faded to black, the last thing I saw the tinkling of candlelight against the grey ceiling.</p>

<p><em>do I at least get paid</em></p>
<p><img alt="Ari lying in a pool of blood on the floor" src="../../../assets/img/illustrations/Ch2-1.png" /></p>
<p>The slamming of a door some distance away snapped me out of unconsciousness. I was lying across the wood-panelled floor of my bedroom, surrounded by a ring of ripped flesh and dried blood. Likely discarded material from after the potion kicked in. I glanced at the walls, clustered with shelves and shelves of assorted books, monster skulls, and my paintings of the Javenshard wilderness. Silently, I clambered upright, only to collapse against the wall next to the door. With a jerking motion, I slammed open the door with a slap of the hand, throwing myself against the upstairs railing as if fired from a slingshot. Movement with a fully repaired body after being recently near-deceased is a little tricky.</p>
<p>A coughing fit ensued as I snapped up to take the stairs down before –</p>
<p>“Ari!” Bia’s voice sang loudly from below. “You in here?!”</p>
<p>“Y-yes,” I spluttered, dragging my feet as I staggered down to our living room. Bia stood next to the table, looking expectantly at the stairs. Her grin faded. A terrible omen – Bia is always making that evil grin of hers.</p>
<p>“What the hell happened?” Bia immediately dropped all pretence of her usual giddiness. “I just got back from stealing Dan’s bottles, what did you do?!”</p>
<p>“I got attacked by a demon, that’s what!” I refueled with energy, glaring daggers at Bia. “This is why we don’t go ANYWHERE near the deep woods. While <em>you</em> were off pilfering the pub, I was getting mauled against by a bleeding ten foot tall metal monster!”</p>
<p>Bia paused, a rare look of hesitation on her face.</p>
<p>“And… what monster was it?”</p>
<p>Wordlessly, I sent over the Governance profile generated for the entity. With that done, I fell violently onto the couch, lying there contemplatively. In retrospect, the entire scene was a little kooky; it looked as if Bia was running a therapy session (which, Immortals forbid, she was definitely not qualified to do).</p>
<p>Bia read over the profile several times, eyes seeing but not comprehending – though that’s what she usually did. Dumbass.</p>

<p>“’Not rooted in Governance system?’ And it shares your Dormant title, but in another magic system?” She coughed nervously. “Last I checked, we’re not living in a fantasy novel, right?”</p>
<p>“How in the twelve hells am I supposed to know?” I hyperventilated. “It hit me twice and I was near dead, I wasn’t contemplating the existence of something that isn’t compatible with the system our society has grown with since – since the Miruen Empire!”</p>
<p>Bia stared out the living room window at the black night. You could just barely see the houses along our street.</p>
<p>“We should tell someone this thing is in the forest. Nothing tier thirteen should be able to take out Ms. Perfect Hastor that easily.”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all should be able to take out any Hastor that easily,” I said, the still-lingering panic overriding her name calling. “How it even got through my passive sensory is a complete mystery. And who would we tell? You think the mayor of this dump can do anything about it? We specifically picked a low rank place like Javenshard to settle down – so we wouldn’t have to deal with crazy stuff like this!”</p>
<p>“You specifically picked Javenshard so you wouldn’t have to deal with crazy stuff like this,” Bia rolled her eyes, and added in a mutter. “Coward.”</p>
<p>“You shut it.”</p>
<p>“No, you,” She retorted with a natural cadence. That was one of her most used phrases, and it was so very annoying. “We can travel over to Troltano and go tell Father ourselves. Or find someone high-tier to take out the thing – Troltano is a tier fifty-sixty area.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going all the way out there while that demon is still around.”</p>
<p>Bia raised an eyebrow. “Why? It’s just a monster. It’ll find other prey and should know better than to go near busy, established roads, much less follow you about.”</p>
<p>I opened her mouth, then closed it, then sighed.</p>
<p>“It’s not after me. It’s after Mother’s hourglass.”</p>
<p>“You- “ Bia spluttered. “What? It’s sentient? It’s not an actual monster?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not. Monsters are fabricated by the Governance to feed faevinity experience, you know this? So, what kind of monster is intelligently motivated not by sadism, but by a specific shiny trinket?”</p>
<p>“Why would it want the hourglass? The thing can’t use the glass’ powers, can it?”</p>
<p>“Don’t think so. It didn’t show off any reality-bending. But hells, I don’t know! It’s a spooky shadow demon, we didn’t learn about those in adventuring school.”</p>
<p>”Check the glass. Is there something on it? Some kind of tracking device? Anything?”</p>
<p>I gently pulled out the hourglass from my shirt. The blood red sands tinkled softly as the trinket moved.</p>

<p>“Ari you selectively deaf dumbass I said that a minute ago.” Bia exclaimed. “If that thing gets into Javenshard it’s going to obliterate everyone. Nobody here is high enough tier to even stand in front of it. Except for Mother, but you know what she’s been like since…”</p>
<p>I groaned. “Y’know, I could just send Father a letter.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you know what he’s like too. He won’t listen to us unless we go slap in him the face ourselves. Besides, a trip will be fun! We’ve been cooped up here for years, we gotta go somewhere else eventually.”</p>
<p>“And the matter of the murder monster after my face?” I glared.</p>
<p>Bia smiled sweetly, leaned forward.</p>
<p>“Oh, I’m sure it’ll be fine. Can we just have a regular, fun, vacation...?”</p>
<p>I only glared harder, purple pupils boring past a sheaf of hair and straight into Bia’s eyes. After a second of silence in which you could practically hear the cartoonishly escalating sound effect-</p>
<p>“Fine.” I relented. “I suppose it was about time I fought something higher rank.”</p>
<p>“Hells yeah!” Bia pumped her fist. “Nice. We should leave… tomorrow morning?”</p>
<p>“Fair enough. I don’t have much to pack.”</p>
<p>“Yes… I’ll call on Golden Boy.”</p>
<p>“Lloyd? Why?”</p>
<p>“Oh, and the Verosavens.”</p>
<p>“You want to bring them along too?!”</p>
<p>“Why not? It’ll be a fun little vacation!”</p>
<p>“Ugh…” I started, extremely unenthused. “Well… as far as I care it’s purely business. And Dan and Rosa are tier threes with non-combat specialties. They won’t last long if that thing comes after us, or if we’re out hunting.”</p>
<p>“They can sit the fighting out,” Bia shrugged nonchalantly. “If the thing’s after your hourglass it won’t care about them.”</p>
<p>“But – you - whatever…”</p>
<p>Bia pumped her fist again. It was extensively rare for me to put up with her bullshit, much less agree with said bullshit. A victory for her – I’d do something petty about it but I’m too exhausted from almost fucking dying. Grinning, Bia stalked over to the stairs and began climbing.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m gonna go get some sleep,” she chittered. “I’d suggest you do that too. We’re leaving seven in the morning tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Noon,” I called, my gaze not leaving the ceiling as Bia ascended the staircase.</p>
<p>“Nine!”</p>
<p>“Noon, Bia.”</p>
<p>“Nine.”</p>
<p>“I hate you.”</p>
<p>Bia laughed and vanished upstairs.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>I stalked my way through the forest trail, legs ripping right through the thorns and brambles. Weak early morning sunlight shone through the forest canopy, lighting up the blooming flowers scattered throughout the underbrush. Small streams ran about the weeds, blighting the dirt with moisture.
Though I was reluctant to leave the vicinity of Javenshard, I suppose we had earned a vacation. I’d worked hard to keep adventuring, and Bia… ahh, Bia did her best. I sound like Mother. Speaking of…</p>
<p>Her cabin was nestled in a jungle of bushes and vines. Stepping over a discarded watering can and towards the door, the soggy wooden steps creaked under my boots. I paused, cringed, but continued on. I knocked thrice.</p>
<p>For a moment, there was silence. I edged backwards against the rain-soaked railing.</p>
<p>Brisk footsteps tapped their way forward and paused too, and then the door swung open.</p>
<p>Duskir Hastor was seventy years old, but she looked only thirty thanks to a hard-earned tier sixty-seven life force. She still had at least a century left – one of the reasons many fae devoted themselves to ranking up. Eighty years always felt too short for me, even with my own extra time.</p>
<p>Mother wore a colourful poncho over a generic set of casual clothing. Her hair was deep purple like all the Hastors. Wild, violet eyes darted around the forest, unable to focus.</p>
<p>“Hello, Ari,” Duskir mumbled, still looking everywhere but at me. “What brings you to my cabin?”</p>
<p>“I have a request for you,” I said.</p>
<p>Duskir looked around hesitantly.</p>
<p>“Mother.”</p>
<p>“…come in.”</p>
<p><img alt="Ari peeks at Duskir's cabin through some vines" src="../../../assets/img/illustrations/Ch2-2.png" /></p>
<p>She scrambled back into the house and slammed the door. Typical Mother. I opened the door again and stepped inside, carefully closing it behind me.
Duskir sat in a rocking chair in front of a table, which was placed uncannily in the centre of the room. She never lit it; the crystal matrix kept the cabin heated had been on for years and I’m pretty sure she’d forgotten it existed. There was only one other chair in the room; Duskir didn’t have guests. I sat casually.</p>
<p>“So, dear,” Duskir asked mechanically. “What bothers you?”</p>
<p>I leaned forward conspiratorially.</p>
<p>“I was attacked in the forest last night. By something that shouldn’t have been in there. Something nobody in Javenshard can fight, except for you.”</p>
<p>Duskir’s eyes narrowed, a rare spark of sanity entering her gaze.</p>
<p>“Show me your logs.”</p>
<p>I mailed over the entity’s Governance description.</p>

<p>“What in the…” Duskir glared at the message accusatorially. She sprang up, hands drooping oddly at the sides. “You aren’t pranking me, are you?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I can’t help you fight that.”</p>
<p>“You know what it is?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and I can’t help you.”</p>
<p>“Then what is it?!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“You said you knew!”</p>
<p>“I’ve met it, but I don’t know what it is.”</p>
<p>I groaned. With Mother, it was more likely she had known but forgot.</p>
<p>“Never mind that,” I said in exasperation. With a flourish, I lifted the hourglass necklace over my head and placed it on the coffee table. “What can you tell me about this?”</p>
<p>Duskir leaned forward.</p>
<p>“Never mind that,” I said in exasperation. With a flourish, I lifted the hourglass necklace over my head and placed it on the coffee table. “What can you tell me about this?”</p>
<p>Duskir leaned forward.</p>
<p>“Never mind that,” I said in exasperation. With a flourish, I lifted the hourglass necklace over my head and placed it on the coffee table. “What can you tell me about this?”</p>
<p>Duskir leaned forward.</p>
<p>The sands tinkled softly.</p>
<p>“Isn’t that…” Duskir started. “That’s the Hastor hourglass. You know what that is.”</p>
<p>“Tell me, is it valuable?”</p>
<p>“Looking to sell it?” Her eyes narrowed dangerously – though her pupils still didn’t focus. “Don’t.”</p>
<p>“How tragic,” I said in deadpan. “Here, Mother, would you like a drink?”</p>
<p>I reached into my dimensional sack and pulled out a filled teacup, handing it to Duskir.</p>

<p>Duskir gazed at it until it her own Governance instance analyzed it. I’m not the best with anything other than fighting, really, so I’d been up all last night trying to fix this thing up. Quite proud of the results. Of course, I didn’t brew the potion, just did the enchantment. Tier fifty is too high for a measly tier seven like myself with mediocre brewing skills.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Ari,” she said, taking a sip. “I’ve always loved the local teas. They taste… honest… …honest… …honest…”</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed.” I said mock-professionally. “In fact, I brewed some of this myself. I’m learning, aye?”</p>
<p>“Well, it tastes wonderful, dear.”</p>
<p>“Of course it does, I made it,” Oof. Shouldn’t have said that. “Now, what can you tell me about the hourglass?”</p>
<p>“It’s an old family heirloom.”</p>
<p>“And where did the Hastors get it?”</p>
<p>Duskir’s eyes suddenly sharpened again.</p>
<p>“I’m not at liberty to disclose that information.”</p>
<p>But my eyes sharpen better. That’s completely irrelevant, but I… I don’t know what my point here is, actually. This is a dead end. Here, have some more cool dialogue.</p>
<p>“Why, have another sip.”</p>
<p>“I think I’ll pa– “</p>
<p>A line of red lightning sprang from my fingers, snapping Duskir’s arms in place.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>My other hand sparked lightning, picking up the teacup and tipping it down her throat.</p>

</details>
<p>“Where is the hourglass from?”</p>
<p>“It was procured by Matriarch Raelia,” Duskir spoke, her voice now lacking what little cadence it had before.</p>
<p>“And who is Raelia?"</p>
<p>“That – that is…”</p>
<p>“Useful to me,” I growled. The teacup tipped more potion into Duskir’s mouth. She went limp, twitching as she spoke.</p>
<p>“She arrived in the northern lands of the old Miruen Empire – just before the Empire itself fell. The first of the Hastor line. She claimed to be a deific entity and was the first of our line.”</p>
<p>“So, one of them con artists then,” I remarked, hands fidgeting with a spark of reality energy. It dissipated against my chair armrest. “Does the hourglass do anything?”</p>
<p>“As far as I know, it only enhances reality-bending abilities,” Duskir’s voice seemed to be sputtering out. Possibly a bad sign? Nah, it’s fine. “It allows us to use them for longer without spontaneously combusting.”</p>
<p>“That’s very enlightening Mother, I already knew that. So why do I have it?”</p>
<p>“I am to pass it down to the next eligible Hastor.”</p>
<p>“Why not Bia?”</p>
<p>“She refused it.”</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>For the first time here, I was confused. I couldn’t see Bia – or anyone – turning down something like that. Hells, I’ll take any free item to even slightly enhance my abilities. More efficient monster hunting, more money.</p>
<p>“Well, this has been somewhat productive.” I gestured towards the door. “I’m going to... leave.”</p>
<p>I waved and left the cabin.</p>
<p>I pondered the information I’d stolen from Mother. I felt a little bad, feeding her a potion like that, but it was the easiest way to get to what I needed.
Though, now that I think it over, this information wasn’t worth much. It’s nothing pivotal. She’s just told me some generic worldbuilding crap that isn’t useful to the plot. Why does Grim want this thing? It’s just some old shiny trinket that it can’t even use because it doesn’t have the Hastors’ specific abilities.</p>
<p>It has to have some sort of agenda. Or is it working under someone else’s agenda???</p>
<p>Grim was insanely powerful. If it was working for something else, what kind of power did they have?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>I sat on a stool in the Bearcroft Inn. No one else was in the building, as it was several hours before the usual opening time at noon. The inn was owned by Dan Verosaven, one of my childhood friends and one of the three Bia had invited along on their trip. We were supposed to meet here at seven with all our stuff packed (and with ‘a good attitude’, said Bia). Despite my previous complaint abouting getting up so early, I’d somehow ended up here before everyone else.</p>
<p>I was drowsily slouched over the bar, reading a book and only comprehending half the words. A shot glass was left empty on the counter. I had no reservations about drinking – good ol’ tier seven me was more than capable of processing alcohol in far larger doses than a regular normie fae. The headache and insomnia were more a result of the brutal beating from Grim. Magical healing was intensely potent at fixing physical damage, but often caused minor aftereffects as backlash.</p>
<p>The creaking of the half-polished front door roused me from my half-sleep.</p>
<p>“Woah, early today?” Bia called dryly. “Not slacking? Who, Aryon?!”</p>
<p>“Morning, Ari,” Dan followed with his scruffy, deep voice.</p>
<p>The Verosaven family was descended from an older line of craftsmen dynasties, all of which had a dark bluish-grey hair and bright orange eye colour. Dan was a twenty year old fae, with voluminous hair and a small beard, with a noble facial structure and eyes that were either expressly bored or jovially amused. His ears were regular fae length, just ten centimetres. A single barb hung at the ends of his ears, curving upwards to meet a strangely blocky formation. He wore a dishevelled tweed jacket over some casual clothes, his hands stuck firmly in his pant pockets.</p>
<p>“Ahh!” I called. “Good morning Dan. Where’s Rosa?”</p>
<p>“No ‘good morning’ for me?” Bia asked in mock hurt. “I’m offended.”</p>
<p>Dan shook his head and walked over to the counter to set down his backpack.</p>
<p>“<em>Be</em> offended,” I scoffed. “It makes me feel better.”</p>
<p>Bia raised a finger and was about to speak before the door slammed open and right into her face.</p>
<p>“WHAT’S UP?” A voice screamed at the top of her lungs.</p>
<p>Rosalith Verosaven pranced in with her usual over energetic demeanour, spinning and waving her arms like maniac, blue-grey ponytail flailing about like a whip. She wore a baggy bright orange hoodie, obscuring her one and a half metre frame. Rosa was the youngest of our group, born three years earlier than her brother. Her ears were a short six centimetres.</p>
<p>Funny little thing about the Verosavens. Back when they had Dan, they were kinda struggling for money. Lower class families here in this continent named their children with less syllables than higher classes. Then, a few years later, they sorta stumbled into a bit of an absolute bloody fortune just lying in the woods. Some kind of fully intact Governance component left behind by some monster.</p>
<p>It was around this time they had Rosa, and with their newfound fortune they could afford some more syllables. Of course, it’s not like they actually had to buy longer names. Just a culture thing that everyone respects around here - plus, it makes a goofy little anecdote I can use to break up the monotony of these idiots’ dialogue.</p>
<p>“Ugh…” Bia moaned in pain, creaking upright and rubbing her nose.</p>
<p>Dan waved silently from behind the counter, not looking up from whatever he was retrieving from the cabinet.</p>
<p>“Oh, hello Rosa,” I said. She glared at Bia, slumped against the wall, her groans getting steadily more comical. “Shut it, you. You’re tier seven, stop being theatrical.”</p>
<p>“Theatrical?!” Bia decried. “Why, I am in utmost pain! Have you no respect for the needy-“</p>
<p>A blade of light swung outwards from my wrist, stabbing into the wood next to Bia’s throat with a twang. The quiet noise of simmering wood filled the room for a brief few seconds before the blade disintegrated.</p>
<p>“As I said,” Ari cooed, miming blowing steam off a gun. “Shut your oral aperture in punctual time, please.”</p>
<p>“Hypocrite,” Bia muttered. “And a pedant too.”</p>
<p>“As I said,” Ari cooed, miming blowing steam off a gun. “Shut your oral aperture in punctual time, please.”</p>
<p>“Hypocrite,” Bia muttered. “And a pedant too.”</p>
<p>“Ari, please don’t fuck up my walls,” Dan chuckled, going back to his counter before popping out with a closed sign. “Ah, here we are,” he continued to the silent room. He walked over to the front door and hung the sign across the door.</p>
<p><strong>BEARCROFT INN</strong>
<strong>CLOSED</strong>
<strong>RENT IS NO LONGER DUE</strong></p>
<p>Dan slowly walked over to a seat and sat down, pulling out a notepad and pencil.</p>
<p>“Ahem,” Rosa loudly cleared her throat. “So… Bia, where’re we off ta? Ya said Ari had to go report some kinda HOA bullshit?”</p>
<p>“That’s extremely inaccurate,” I laughed. “I was attacked by a demon.”</p>
<p>“Spooky.” Rosa said in a bored voice. “So, yes, HOA bullshit.”</p>
<p>“What kind of logic - “
“A pair of large, obese ls.”
I dragged a hand over my face. Rosalith was equal parts annoying and enjoyable in conversation.</p>
<p>“Rosa, you didn’t steal some of my stock too didya?” Dan called, then pointed at Bia. “And I know what <em>you</em> did last night.”</p>
<p>“Absolutely no idea what you are talking about, Dan,” Bia said cheerfully.</p>
<p>“Okay then…” Dan said, narrowing his eyes.</p>
<p>“Nice,” Bia said. “Now that these unfounded accusations have been cleared… We all here?”</p>
<p>“We’re missing -”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the cue Ari - WHERE THE FUCK IS LLOYD?!”</p>
<p><img alt="Ari, Rosa, Dan, and Bia in the inn." src="../../../assets/img/illustrations/Ch2-3.png" /></p>
<p>“Here!” A voice called as the door swung open again.</p>
<p>“Oh, speak of the plot convenience!” Rosa rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>Lloyd rushed in, dropping a pair of extradimensional bags on the ground before quickly straightening up.</p>
<p>Lloyden was the last person Bia had invited along. His golden hair curled around his face neatly, topped with a red cap. He wore an unnaturally clean jacket that looked to be on the higher end of the quality spectrum. It was unlike him to be the last person to arrive to any given meeting, what with his constant obsession with acting professional. Must have had shitty parents or something, I dunno.</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m late,” He said profusely. “It’s simply the pinnacle of disappointment that I’ve delayed the proceedings of this gathering. I make clear my regret in - “</p>
<p>Rosa grabbed one of the chairs and slammed it into his chest. It didn’t hurt him - he was a tier seven adventurer like myself, and Rosa had no tier at all. He did, however, stumble back in shock.</p>
<p>“Can you all stop causing property damage?” Dan said, though he sounded just as bored as usual.</p>
<p>“That’s absolutely so very interesting,” Rosalie said, ignoring her brother. “Alright, thanks for the recap, Golden Boy, but we really didn’t need that much.” She turned to Bia. “What’re we doing again?”</p>
<p>“We’re going to Troltano,” I answered, as her neck snapped around to me instead. “To hire a higher tier adventuring party to clear out whatever attacked me last night.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Troltano. That’s in… what, the south?”</p>
<p>“Yes. At the border of the Sammemmnon province. You’ve graduated, you must know the local geography.”</p>
<p>“No, I’m stupid.”</p>
<p>“Hey, relatable!” Bia said.</p>
<p>Lloyd settled down on a bar stool next to Ari and pulled out a drinking flask, warily watching the chair he’d been slammed with.</p>
<p>“So!” Bia announced. “Does everyone have their luggage?”</p>
<p>A chorus of assent echoed through the room.</p>
<p>“Righto! Off we go then! I have the crabs ready in the lot.”</p>
<p>She marched right out the door.</p>
<p>“What does she mean by crabs?” Rosa asked.</p>
<p>“No idea, but it’s probably something stupid,” I replied, before following my sister outside.</p>

</details>
<p>“Those are not horses.”</p>
<p>Bia had apparently bought a bunch of crabs. Not a van, not a car, not even a horse. Three six foot tall crabs standing in the street outside the inn, each fitted with a saddle.</p>
<details class="governance" open="open">
<summary>Creature: [Hexacampus] (Crustacean)</summary>
<p>Average Tier: V</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A large crab creature, usually four or five feet tall. Its legs make up most of that height, as they are nearly vertical when standing. They shuffle like all crabs, but are able to do so at extreme speed, rivalling that of a traditional motorized vehicle. Because of this, fae use them as mounts, but they are rarely seen due to how hard to tame they are.</p>
</details>
<p>“Bia,” I said, annoyed. “Why in the seven hells did you buy hexacampi? How bloody expensive was this?!”</p>
<p>“Cars and horses are just so default y’know?” She exclaimed, leading one to kneel low enough to step on. “Now, six gigantic ass-kicking megacrabs? Not only is that just really frickin’ sick, this is also a golden opportunity to show off some kooky worldbuilding!”</p>
<p>“Interesting statement,” Dan said. He was still standing in the doorway, writing away on his notepad. Not even gigacrabs could shock away his stoicism. Rosa was already next to one of the hexacampi, rapidly flitting around it as she inspected the creature.</p>
<p>“I have some… concerns,” She said. “The practicality of riding creatures that walk sideways, for example.”</p>
<p>Lloyd raised a finger. “Faevinity have been employing hexacampi as mounts since the Miruen Empire. Though not commonly seen in Eorwin – “</p>
<p>“Shp-shp-shp,” Bia rolled her eyes. “Lloyd, just one sentence is enough. Look: These things are fast – and definitely sensible in the evolutionary landscape. Not that hard! I could even have cut off that part about the evolutionary landscape, but that adds a nice little tidbit of comedy, which is necessary for unknown reasons.”</p>
<p>Bia mounted one of the crabs and tapped its shell, which sent it rocketing off as she grabbed the straps attached to the saddle.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I had these for quite a while already. Trained em myself too,” She guided the hexacampus off down the street, past the inn’s garden and then circled back around.</p>
<p>“That’s fuckin’ sick,” Rosa exclaimed, eyes wide.</p>
<p>“I know right?!” Bia exclaimed back.</p>
<p>“I could run faster than one of those,” I scoffed, rolling my eyes. “Dan?”</p>
<p>I look up and spot Dan already on a hexacampus as it waddled off at a leisurely pace. He was still writing in the notebook, having ignored our bickering.</p>
<p>“Should’ve expected that,” I muttered, then moved towards one of the crabs. It snapped a pincer at me, so I conjured a knife and swiped back.</p>
<p>“Easy with the crabs!” Bia called. “They were actually pretty expensive. But we’re rich! But also, they were expensive.”</p>
<p>I glared at her, then the crab. The hexacampus eventually decided to kneel down, so I stepped on – though still with some difficulty. Four foot tall. Lloyd did the same with his.</p>
<p>Rosa hopped right up onto hers, which promptly zoomed off at a speed expected of a tier five creature. It whirled off down the street, Rosa screaming on its back.</p>
<p>“BIA! I thought you trained these!”</p>
<p>“Uh, yep, I did,” Bia said shiftily. “Jobber must be a bit excited.”</p>
<p>I turned to look at her incredulously as Rosa continued.</p>
<p>“How long ago exactly did you buy these?”</p>
<p>“A week! I got em from this guy I met at the inn.”</p>
<p>“We’re supposed to depend on massive crabs that you bought off a random guy in Dan’s inn, which you only trained for a week. Oh yeah, and they’re also the size of a car and have gigantic pincers.”</p>
<p>“Relax! It’s fine. I have a way with animals. I think.”</p>
<p>I looked pointedly at the rapidly re-approaching dot that was Rosa and the crab.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“Ehehe. I told him to do that,” Bia whispered to me. I sighed.</p>
<p>“Rosa!” I called, ignoring Bia’s protests. “You should tell Bia to fuck off!”</p>
<p>“Why?!” She yelled back.</p>
<p>“It’ll be funny!”</p>
<p>“BIA! FUCK YOU!”</p>
<p>Eventually, we managed to get ‘Jobber’ under control, and we set off to leave Javenshard. There wasn’t a lot of luggage, as everything was carried in dimensional bags. I was quite glad to have bought those bags – absolute lifesavers, I’ll tell ya. Even so, they had taken quite a hunk out of our funds back when Bia and I bought them for the business. In the words of Bia, they were expensive. But also, we’re rich! But also, they’re expensive.</p>
<p>We rode out past the inn and towards the town’s walls. Towns here in the north of the Haequar province either built walls or made delicious meals for the monsters. The adventurers here may be able to mitigate that a little, but Javenshard was small enough that everyone pretty much knew everyone. Except for myself, of course. Yes, I had the great privilege of social skills! I just didn’t bother to use them.</p>
<p>Anyway, the town was small, so adventurers weren’t very common here. There were only three or four residents besides Bia and myself. Oh, and Lloyd, but he wasn’t local. Based on what I’d seen of their fights, the locals’ skills were… severely lacking. Even just Bia was an entirely different paradigm compared to them, and that’s saying a lot! To myself, they were children. Little little children, dabbling in the grown-up’s business.</p>
<p>Rosalie was fuming with Bia after the incident with ‘Jobber’. They were still trading increasingly nonsensical insults up ahead. Dan had joined in, not taking sides but simply overanalyzing every word of their conversation. I was sat on a hexacampus, riding next to Lloyd.</p>
<p>“So,” he said. “Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“What?” I said, surprised. “What d’you mean?”</p>
<p>“You look gloomy. Someone kill the cat?”</p>
<p>“Lloyd, what are you on about? Everything’s fine.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s fine, Ari,” Lloyd said inquisitively. “Didn’t you like… half die yesterday?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. You know the risks, Lloyd, you’re an adventurer too. We half die all the time.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean it doesn’t suck.”</p>
<p>“Look, I’m fine,” I gestured, exasperated. “I got stabbed, I healed back up. The stabber was a little weird, but I’m fine. Stop worrying!”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. I was just checking. Because, like, Bia’s kind of silly, and Rosa takes after her. And Dan is just weird. They don’t make the best support.”</p>
<p>“Heh. Bia is very silly,” I looked at the road, cutting through the forest. Bia, Rosa, and Dan were still chattering up ahead. “Well, thanks for giving a shit, but I don’t need it.”</p>
<p>“Ari, Ari. Alright, then,” He laughed. “Well, did you get anything valuable out of yesterday’s haul?”</p>
<p>“Um, I don’t know. Wait… yes! Yeah, Bia looted a crienbeast and got a Governance core. Sick, right?”</p>
<p>“Really?” Lloyd’s eyes went wide. “I’ve been adventuring two years and I haven’t seen a single one.”</p>
<p>“Hell yeah!” I pumped a fist. “We’ll probably sell it when we get to Evedast. I would have done it this morning, or when we get to Roriodo later, but there aren’t many people with the money nor use for such a thing.”</p>
<p>“And you do?”</p>
<p>“I’m rich. Adventuring pays great when you know what you’re doing. But I’m not much of a ritualist, no. Nor an artificer. I mean, I could probably make something with it – ”</p>
<p>“So you’re saying you don’t.”</p>
<p>“Welllllll I wouldn’t say that. I’m just, specialized in other things.”</p>
<p>Lloyd chuckled. “Right. Such as?”</p>
<p>“Killing, and more killing.”</p>
<p>“How diverse. I can at least do artifice.”</p>
<p>“But I can do that too!”</p>
<p>“Oh, really? What’s the best thing you’ve made?”</p>
<p>“Um, I don’t know,” I shrugged. “Lemme look through my bag.”</p>
<p>I swung the dimensional backpack onto my lap, reaching my arm in. Most high quality dimensional bags had a function that gave users an instinctual sense of whatever was inside. No idea how it worked - I’m not a ritualist. It was probably some sort of instrument that interfaced with the user’s aura (/Presence but we only use that for the spooky dramatic weirdos). Actually, why am I considering this when these things can fit a whole ass banquet table into a space the size of a fist?</p>
<p>Whatever. Anyway, I searched the bag for something cool. I’d seen Lloyd’s work – he made lots of magic items. Magic darts, potion belts, even some cool little knives I’d seen him engraving ritual circles onto. I’d have to match his standard.</p>
<p>I shuffled through the various objects. A potion, another potion, and a lot more potions. I hadn’t really made anything except potions. Then I sensed it – the puppet.</p>
<p>It was a white rabbit puppet, with no eyes, a massive open mouth, and a bow tie.</p>
<details class="governance" open="open">
<summary>Item: [Rabbit Puppet] (Puppet)</summary>
<p>Tier: 0</p>
<p>Made by: Aryon Hastor</p>
<p><em>I don’t fucking know it’s a rabbit puppet.</em></p>
</details>
<p>I didn’t remember making it, but it had my name on it. The Governance didn’t lie – I must’ve forgotten it. The puppet was simple, but it was also very high quality. It would do.</p>
<p>“Aha!” I said triumphantly, pulling the puppet out and dangling it from my finger.</p>
<p>“Is that… a rabbit?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea, but it has my name on it and it looks cool.”</p>
<p>I handed him the puppet, and he turned it over, inspecting it.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not half bad.”</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>“It’s fully bad.”</p>
<p>I shot him a flat look.</p>
<p>The crabs moved efficiently under Bia’s direction – a miracle, as Bia never did anything efficiently. After three hours of tireless riding, the walls of Roriodo came into view. Grand stone walls - which were, in reality, frauds! You think these poor, low tier villages could be even that capable? Nah, all of these are just metre thick walls with fear rituals in them. If a monster wanted in, they got in. They were just deterred from wanting it.</p>
<p>We passed through the gates, which had extra rituals on them cos they were extra flimsy. Inside, Roriodo was much like Javenshard. Settlements here often grew into series of rings, as a function of the Governance. The Governance made a point of infiltrating each and every aspect of fae life, and the building of settlements was just one of the many areas it helped facilitate.</p>
<p>I’d only been here once before, having crossed through it when Bia and I originally came to Javenshard years ago. The monsters were marginally higher rank back north, so I saw no point backtracking. Bia, however, did.</p>
<p>“Afternoon, Dahr!” Bia called from the back of her hexacampus as we passed by a man with a straw hat. He was digging through a coat with so many pockets it was more negative space than matter.</p>
<p>“Bia! Good to see ya,” Dahr raised a fishing pole from the rack next to him in greeting. “I see ye got yer dirty rich hands on a crabbo. What I wouldn’t give to fish up one of those things! Except, of course, a hefty sum of cash to one.”</p>
<p>“Of course, of course,” Bia laughed as we rode away. “Hope your next catch goes good!”</p>
<p>Dahr raised a hand in farewell, then returned to digging through his coat.</p>
<p>I steered my hexacampus towards Bia’s.</p>
<p>“You know this guy?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know everyone here,” she replied.</p>
<p>“Everyone,” I repeated incredulously.</p>
<p>“Look, it’s not a bad thing to have a social life. Try it out sometime.”</p>
<p>Bia wasn’t lying when she said she knew everyone in Roriodo. I could swear that she greeted literally every civilian we passed by. And I use the term civilian specifically – there were definitely no adventurers here. Or at least, no adventurer worth paying attention to. I could probably decimate this whole town in a week! With Bia and Lloyd – fuck it, a day, tops. Adventurers as skilled as us are super rare ‘round the northen end of Haelcrien. </p>
<p>Eventually, Bia brought us to the stables that she used when she’d come around Roriodo in the past (she rented a horse sometimes). They didn’t usually receive hexacampi, but Bia’s bullshitting, charisma, and mysterious goodwill with Roriodoans convinced em to deal with our rides. With those taken care of, we started looking for somewhere to stay the night.</p>
<p>“So, what’s it like here in these other northern towns?” Rosa asked me giddily.</p>
<p>“Ask Bia instead,” Dan said in his usual I-am-very-bored-and-therefore-cool tone. “Ari doesn’t leave Javenshard. She has no social life.”</p>
<p>“Why does everyone keep saying that?” I spun around, braid twirling.</p>
<p>“Because it’s true?” chimed Lloyd.</p>
<p>“That’s one know-it-all comment I can stomach!” Rosa said. Lloyd pumped his fist. “Okay, Ari, you’re boring.” She zipped to Bia’s side with speed that didn’t befit a tierless fae.</p>
<p>“So, Bia, what’s it like in the other northern towns?”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s fucking weird,” Bia said. “And I like it that way. These non-Ari, happy and fun civilian types are really quite pleasant to be around and do indeed have a social life…”</p>
<p>I shook my head and walked along, panning my eyes over the street. The town was composed mostly from stone-walled cabins with wooden roofs, as was standard this far north and this far from true civilization. A rare few metal-scaffolding buildings were scattered around the town’s central square, but other than that, it was quite quaint.</p>
<p>“Ohhh yeah!” Bia spouted suddenly. “Rosa, Dan. We should get you some adventuring gear.”</p>
<p>Dan shrugged.</p>
<p>“Ooooh yes,” Rosa answered with matching enthusiasm. “Definitely. Must have. Fighting monsters? Cool as all hells.”</p>
<p>“Oh come on,” I said. “We can’t get you shit here. Roridio is not an adventuring town and I will not have my idiots going around in discount gear.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry,” came Bia. “I know a guy.”</p>
<p>“You seem to know a lot of people here.”</p>
<p>“I have a social —“</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>Bia guided us to a box that was the picture of theatrically pretentious impure hermetic-cabin-in-the-woods-ness. Logs were stacked atop one another for the logs — but it was blatantly just a facade over some smooth and insulated wood and metal. The other, more obvious facade was the sloped roof, which was in fact just a flat decorative piece stood up on the roof of the building. It was like the building was trying harder to look fake than to actually hide behind its various pretenses.</p>
<p>What I mean to say is, it looked suspicious as hell.</p>
<p>Bia proceeded to barge her way in like an overconfident protagonist blissfully unaware of their various financial deficits. The wooded plank doors declined. I marched up next to her and pushed the doors to either side. They were sliding doors — I know my shady businesses.</p>
<p>“Oh bloody hells,” Bia muttered as I continued in. “Really?!”</p>
<p>“Haven’t you been here before?” Lloyd asked her.</p>
<p>“Yeah, but Noka keeps changing shit up. Marketing maybe. Why in Ayueso’s name does anyone use sliding doors?! They’re so goddamned inelegant.”</p>
<p>“Ayueso would not like scum uttering her name, I’d wager,” I drawled in monotone, walking up to a bench placed at the side of the room. I sat down and gazed expectantly at the door like a disappointed mother. “Also, the Trinity doesn’t exist. Basic firmament theory proved that two decades ago and we’re still dealing with damned Stagnants.”</p>
<p>“You say hells all the time,” Bia complained.</p>
<p>“The hells are cool, and — “</p>
<p>“Well actually, they’re a purely metaphysical space in which heat does not exist.”</p>
<p>“Shut the fuck up.”</p>
<p>The other three filed in as Bia walked up to the counter and rang a bell. We waited awkwardly until a tall woman in a discount sorceress outfit stumbled into view.</p>
<p>“Bia!” she said in cheerful greeting, trying too hard to fake an old woman’s voice.</p>
<p>“Hello, Noka,” Bia replied in the squeakiest tone she could muster. “Have you any burgers?”</p>
<p>They both burst out laughing.</p>
<p>“You do realize making inside jokes in front of people who don’t know them just makes you look crazy?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I am crazy!” Bia replied with a giggle.</p>
<p>“For burgers,” Noka added delightfully.</p>
<p>“Oh for fuck’s sake,” I sighed, pushing Bia away as she fell into a laughing fit. “Morning – Noka, was it? We’re here to get a pair of zeroes some adventuring gear. Loath as I am to believe in anything Bia recommends, the adventuring industry here sucks ass and you’re the only place we could find. As team leader –”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” Rosa interjected. “Whoever said – “</p>
<p>“Me. We wouldn’t be out here if I hadn’t gotten mauled by a malicious fleshy cheese grater. As team leader –”</p>
<p>“As team leader,” Bia cut in joyously. “My job is to ensure my people’s safety –”</p>
<p>“And I demand a sample of your wares,” I cut back in, glaring at Bia. She had an odd ability to predict exactly what someone was about to say. Lloyd laughed.</p>
<p>“Oh, I assure you my wares are perfectly up to standard,” Noka said, leaning over the desk with a leering grin. I stared back with half-lids.</p>
<p>She unlocked the gate into the backroom and stepped in with a waving gesture. We followed through the door into a storage room the size of a walk-in closet. There was no equipment here; just piles of leather that I guessed to be dimensional bags. Noka poised to begin looking for something – then turned back around.</p>
<p>“Say, what archetype you going for?”</p>
<p>“Say what?” Rosa asked.</p>
<p>“She means,” I answered. “If you want to be a mage or warrior or seven foot tall globular mass or whatever the fuck.”</p>
<p>“What’s the coolest one?”</p>
<p>“Me. High skill high damage and zero margin of error.”</p>
<p>“Scout archetypes are pretty fun too,” Lloyd said.</p>
<p>“Lloyd, you’ve only ever tried that archetype.”</p>
<p>“And you –”</p>
<p>“My adventuring journey was a long succession of formulative experiences of emotional depth –”</p>
<p>“Fuck you Ari, you’re boring,” Bia jumped in. “As a support spellcaster with suspiciously offensive blood powers, I can assure you that my specialization –”</p>
<p>“Has a cool factor based entirely off eye candy and zero effectiveness.”</p>
<p>“Bullshit!”</p>
<p>“Look Bia, you barely ever contribute –”</p>
<p>“Hi,” said Rosa, holding up a green cloak and some light-looking fabric garments, lined with silver decor. “Can y’all shut up? I picked something.”</p>
<p>“Let me inspect it,” Bia said.</p>
<p>“No NO, you have no expertise in this field. I literally had to buy you your own gear because you went to the wrong goddamn side of the city and instead of heading back got drunk in some shitstand bar all fucking day at twelve fucking noon –”</p>
<p>“Woah, woah, woah!” Bia exclaimed, arms wide. “I have, no IDEA! what you are talking about!”</p>
<p>Dan wheezed in the background.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to tell us that story sometime,” Lloyd grinned.</p>
<p>“Whatev,” I reached out for the green garment and gave it a tap.</p>

<p>“Told you scouts were cool,” Lloyd nudged Bia in my peripherals.</p>
<p>“Light clothing doesn’t make you a scout!” Bia shout-whispered.</p>
<p>“Oh that’s actually…” I looked back at Noka, who grinned irritably. “The hell are you doing in a dingy hole like this?”</p>
<p>“I’m rich and like making shit,” she replied. “I also hate dealing with the general public, so I only take customers Bia brings over. Which turns out to be a lot more than I expected on account of her having a social life.”</p>
<p>This comment prompted narrowed eyes to Bia. She smiled innocently.</p>
<p>“Valid lifestyle then,” I approved, then turned to Rosalith. “Archery, aye? I recall your aim was never the best w hen we played warball.”</p>
<p>“Practice makes perfect!” she replied matter-of-factly.</p>
<p>“Procrastination makes perfect,” Bia said.</p>
<p>“Perfection is a fictional construct, ” said Lloyd.</p>
<p>“Philosophers thou art not,” I sighed. “Rosa, I’m assuming you actually have the money for this.”</p>
<p>“Oh wait, money exists,” Rosa said in tongue of poor. “Noka, how much?”</p>
<p>Suffice to say she blanched at the number.</p>
<p>“And Dan – ”</p>
<p>“Way ahead of you mate,” Dan stuffed an armoured-something into a dimensional bag. Two blades with inset green gems lay against the wall next to him.</p>
<p>“How the hell did you –”</p>
<p>“Did you four not notice that I contributed zero dialogue to your threeway pissing contest? Rosa, I’ll cover your costs. You’re making dinner for a week the next we get back though.”</p>
<p>Rosa raised a finger, then put it down with a sigh.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>We found a place to stay the night – which wasn’t very hard with how many times Bia’s been here. She’s probably got a bajillion discounts on every hotel in the town, little freak.</p>
<p>Dinner’s been had and I’m not describing the chaotic mess that was – the others are still down there screaming at each other. I’m up in mine and Bia’s room painting, pulling from memory. Tier seven lets me do that without getting a headache.</p>
<p>“So,” Lloyd says from the couch, putting down his book. “Where else are we stopping before Troltano?”</p>
<p>I put down another brushstroke against a tall alpine trunk.</p>
<p>“Another little town called Evedast. I think that’s about it. Can’t wait to get out of here so Bia can stop obnoxiously knowing every single little thing about – everything.”</p>
<p>Lloyd laughed.</p>
<p>“Yeah, she’s real annoying sometimes. Funny though.”</p>
<p>“Never admit that in my company, Lloyd.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I turned back to the painting and crossed shadows across the sky.</p>
<p>“So what’re ya painting?”</p>
<p>“Javen Woods.”</p>
<p>“Do you paint anything else?”</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, not really.</p>
<p>“I painted the street some times.”</p>
<p>“What about, people?” </p>
<p>I cocked an eyebrow. A dark silhouette appears left-bottom canvas.</p>
<p>“Not often, and always from the back. People are weird. Good to sketch, but I don’t like painting them. Too many planes on the face. Weird topography and I can never get it right.”</p>
<p>“I see. Maybe try that sometime?”</p>
<p>“And who would I paint?”</p>
<p>“People you spend a lot of time with, I’d guess. Or yourself, that’d look pretty good.”</p>
<p>“I’m not putting up a painting of myself on my bedroom wall. It would look narcissistic.”</p>
<p>I glared a splotch on the canvas that would not look right whichever way I painted over it.</p>
<p>“Artists make self-portraits all the time.”</p>
<p>“And where’d ya hear that? You took art in school?”</p>
<p>“No no, I didn’t.”</p>
<p>“Actually, where did you learn to fight?” I asked, now aggressively stabbing the paint blob. “It certainly wasn’t in these backwaters.”</p>
<p>“My family actually comes from the Delirian Isles. We’re scholars, by tradition, but I wanted something a little different. I had a… falling out with them.”</p>
<p>“What happened?” I inquired.</p>
<p>“They didn’t like where my life was going,” he shrugged. “Assholes. I still keep in touch with my cousin Ramuj though. He’s a cool guy. Does work for the Eden Repository in Edenthein.”</p>
<p>“Nice,” I said, having run out of things to discuss. Holding a conversation was not one of my best skills.</p>
<p>There was silence for a while. I seethed one last time at that splotch before starting to take down the easel.</p>
<p>“I should probably go to sleep now,” I said. “Tier seven or not, rest is important – they always drove that home back in the big city.”</p>
<p>“Big city?” Lloyd asked.</p>
<p>“Where we immigrated from. Parents never bothered telling me and I took enough of a hint not to ask.”</p>
<p>“Odd.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to sleep now. You should probably go too.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, okay. See you tomorrow, yeah?”</p>
<p>“No shit, where else would we be?”</p>

<p>Firstdays. Who even decided to call them that? Horrid. Sometimes I feel like this world is lazily scrapped together by duct tape and glue. 
Today we set out for Evedast, the next little shithole town in our path – though I believe there is a modicum of industry there. It’s a farming town, I think. Vyne fruit, for the wineries further south.</p>
<p>First order of business was to herd Bia’s obsession out of the stables we commandeered last night.  After a nice shower, I headed over to the stables where we put our hexacampi. The others were already there. Lloyd perked up as I arrived, being the only one not engaged in pointless bullshitting. Dan and Rosa are doubtless arguing about something. Bia pats and whispers sweet unworths to a hexacampus.</p>
<p>As I watched the interaction, a wave of disapproval washed over.</p>
<p>“Bia, how much did these cost again?” I asked her.</p>
<p>“I don’t know Ari, numbers are for nerds.” Bia said, not bothering to turn around.</p>
<p>“Ari, you’re looking way too deep into this!” Rosa, joyously. “Sometimes, you just need big crabs in your life.”</p>
<p>I sighed and started helping with the hexacampi.</p>
<p>The hexacampi’s eyes stared blankly at me, to an almost unsettling degree. Thankfully, I was able to hear Bia giggling in time and I moved out of the way before the crab trampled over me. Rosa wasn’t nearly as fortunate, getting kicked back a couple of feet into the cobblestone.</p>
<p>“I’m starting to worry about the combat effectiveness of this group.” Lloyd said, smoothly boarding his hexacampus.</p>
<p>“Everything is fine, you have my word,” Bia said dismissively.</p>
<p>“There seems to be a lot of those going around,” I said, before getting onto my Hexacampus.</p>
<p>“Does anyone know where Dan is?” Rosa said, dusting herself off.</p>
<p>“Right here,” he says from atop another crab.</p>
<p>“How the fuck do you do that?” Rosa jumped. “Did you rank up behind my back or something? Uber-level your stealth skill?”</p>
<p>“Some people are just better than others,” Dan says solemnly. His facade promptly falls apart into laughter.</p>
<p>“Also,” began Lloyd. “Skills don’t actually make you better at something.”</p>
<p>He then turned to look sternly at Rosa. “You’re an adventurer now, you need to know these things.”</p>
<p>I laughed, not sure if he was even joking. That was about the highest level of humour Lloyd had.</p>
<p>“He’s right.” I said as we began moving. “Adventuring is a life or death business. You need to know what you’re doing or it’ll become a death business.”</p>
<p>“Mhmm,” agreed Lloyd, perking up as discussion of his specialist topic cropped up. Oh, <em>that’s</em> probably why he’s always nerding out. From Deliria and all that. Dunno how it took me this long to realize that. “Skills are actually kind of useless. They don’t enhance your ability or limit your ability. They’re purely visual representatives.”</p>
<p>“Please stop,” Rosa said. “I did not sign up for an informative monologue.”</p>
<p>“Oh, we’re only just getting started,” Lloyd beamed. “It’s a long path to Evedast and no one culls the monsters out here. An encounter is inevitable. And I sure as hell am not letting any of you ungrateful fucks die to a big rat or a… beanstalk… or…”</p>
<p>“Or your own stupidity,” I finished. “Probably the largest factor, and that’s not a joke. Which is why it’s imperative you learn.”</p>
<p>“You’re all boring,” Rosa rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>“Okay, fuckin’ pissbaby,” Lloyd rolled his own eyes with the seven-times multiplier of tier seven speed. Well, it’s probably not actually x7. Ask the man himself, I’m no expert.</p>
<p>“He’s right, Ros,” Dan murmured offsidedly. “Fifteen and you still act four.”</p>
<p>“I’m sixteen dumbass!”</p>
<p>“I know, I get it wrong on purpose because I know you’ll be a <em>pissbaby</em> about it.”</p>
<p>“Little shi –”</p>
<p>“Hi, hello,” Bia jumps in, having finally mounted her own hexacampus. “Can we go now? I’d love to lazily quip about here for a few more hours but we got places to go!”</p>
<p>I laughed, but mounted my own crab regardless. “Never thought I’d hear you advocating for efficiency.”</p>
<p>“I am the secret backbone of this group,” Bia said in mock smugness.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>The stars have reached their bright yellow high-noon luminance and we’re only about halfway to Roriodo – and somehow only just encountered a low-tier monster pack. By which I mean the first monster of the trip – magic levels are too low here. Miraculous for Haelcrien standards and for my writing load. Tier seven does not in fact trivialize pencil soreness.</p>
<p>“How far now?” Bia called from the back of the group. We’d set up a formation on approach to the monsters – such tactics were wholly unnecessary for myself, my sister, and Lloyd, but with zeroes in company it was better safe than sorry.</p>
<p>I checked my tablet. The ping location was still six hundred metres to our east.</p>
<details class="governance" open="open">
<summary>Creature: [Voracrest] (Avian)</summary>
<p>Average Tier: III</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>A raptor looking monster. Possesses razor teeth and wings composed of many sharp cartilage fragments. Small three-clawed hands are attached to the ends of the wings. They are covered in feathers that stay soft until hit, at which point they harden to protect the raptor.</p>
</details>
<p>“Only a few hundred metres,” I said, checking my tablet. “Don’t you have your own scanner?”</p>
<p>“Nope!”</p>
<p>“Buy one in Troltano. Or maybe Evedast, but I don’t know how developed their adventuring industry is there. Lloyd, you can go in now.”</p>
<p>“Alright,” said the Golden Boy, then dismounted his crab and dashed into the trees with the scrape of daggers leaving scabbards.</p>
<p>“What’s he doing?” Rosa asked.</p>
<p>“Gathering intel in advance,” Bia said matter of factly. “Usually we wouldn’t for low-tier mons, but –”</p>
<p>“He’s killing all but two of the tier oners so you two can have a fair fight,” I corrected offhandedly. “Don’t sugarcoat things for them Bia. It’s bad practice and there’s no way exactly two tier one voracrest manifest. Sad excuse for a pack.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on Ari,” Bia rolled her eyes. “Intelligent people might know so, but stupid is the Verosaven family motto!”</p>
<p>“That was unwarranted,” said Dan. He was somehow keeping his balance while standing upright on a moving hexacampus, putting on his armour.</p>
<p>“Fuck you,” said Rosa. She was miserably failing to tie the one knot on her weird enchanted cloak-thing, crouching on her mount while looking like she thought she was standing and this was a legendary feat of acrobatics.</p>
<p>Trees and shrubbery rolled past us as we inched closer towards the pack of voracrest. This section of the forest was closer to the more temperate centre of Haelcrien, so the trees spaced further, which meant we could take the hexacampi hunting without getting them stuck. I mean, maybe that would’ve been better. I’d have an excuse to cut em up north Haelcrien’s mostly inland, and I’ve never tried crab before. Heard it tastes good though. Also, it’d piss Bia off and that’s always a plus.</p>
<p>I checked the scanner again – fifty metres. Sure enough, my tier seven senses promptly picked up the oily scent of monsters. They all seemed to smell like that – probably a side effect of the Governance’s production process. You’d feel them too, like you could feel ranked fae and just about any ranked creature. Something about the whole Presence thing with the high rankers.</p>
<p>“Stop!” I called as my ears picked up the whistling of wind. Lloyd’s back.</p>
<p>The rest of the party halted their hexacampi and dismounted as a gilded blur spun into being in front of us, daggers still twirling in his hands as they reentered their sheaths.</p>
<p>“Cleared to two voracrest as requested,” Lloyd said curtly. The man was weird when adventuring; usually he’s more casual but the moment a modicum of danger comes into play he turns into a drill sergeant. He shrugs towards Dan and Rosa. “You can send the zeroes in now.”</p>
<p>I waved the party forwards, following the scanner.</p>
<p>“The <em>zeroes</em> have a name,” Rosa said, fooling around with a bow and arrow and definitely holding them wrong. I’m not expert but I still know some archery basics. The Verosavens, on the other hand, never took a combat education.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’d have been prudent,” Dan said after an exasperated glance. “To hold off on giving this girl dangerous weaponry until she can take an archery course.”</p>
<p>“I’m sure she’ll be fine,” Bia said, conjuring her scythe. The siblings should be able to handle this one, but better safe than sorry. I summoned my dagger.</p>
<p>“<em>She</em> is right here!”</p>
<p>“And so are the voracrest,” I notified them. Right on cue, a shrill reptilian call preceded a blurry figure launching out of the trees. Rosa shrieked as a forty pound mass of feathers and scales crashed into her and began tearing at her with razor claws.</p>
<p>“You’re a ranged specialization, Rosa!” I called in the best approximation of encouragement my sarcastic voice could manage. I threw out a stack of shields between her incredibly non-durable gear and the voracrest’s incisors. She sighed in relief under the respite.</p>
<p>“Now, this is where you expertly roll away before –”</p>
<p>Another scream and the smell of fresh blood. The voracrest are on her again from the side. Immortals help us all, these people are too incompetent. And Bia, that’s not religious, that’s fact based. They found gods or some shit in the Void a few years ago and all the old trinitians are still freaking out. I turned away. Lloyd will clean up her attacker.</p>
<p>The other voracrest wooshed through the trees and at me. I punched the thing in the side and it spontaneously redirected at Dan, who seemed slightly more prepared and already had his shield up. With a surprising amount of precision, he spins with knife in hand and plunges it into the raptor’s chest.
“You seem oddly good at this,” I said.</p>
<p>“I’m an innkeeper,” Dan replied, taking out another knife and using the two blades like chopsticks in the soup of the raptor’s forehead. “You adventurers think monsters are bad, but customer service is a whole other frontier.”</p>
<p>Rosa stumbled over while downing a healing potion, her shirt covered in scratches and blood. Her flesh began to weave back together. Bia was looting the voracrest a ways away – Rose had done no damage to it and therefore would get nothing from trying to loot it. Strictly speaking, tier zeroes shouldn’t be using tier three healing potions, but Bia, Lloyd, and I don’t buy anything lower and it’s <em>usually</em> fine.</p>
<p>She collapsed by a tree and gasped passively.</p>
<p>“I think I’d rather serve drinks.”</p>
<p>“Good,” Dan said. “You can do that instead of making dinner as compensation for your gear.”</p>
<p>Rosa didn’t bother respond, groaning as her flesh sizzled to health. Dan tapped and looted the corpse, the currency energy flowing into him along with the experience. Bluish light enveloped him for a second – he grinned.</p>
<p>“Well wouldya look at that,” Lloyd grinned as well, walking over and giving Dan a pat on the back. “Welcome to the club.”</p>
<p>“Your membership is the lowest tier,” I added. “But at least the Governance isn’t an inherently capitalist system.”</p>
<p>“Well, the higher tier rank advantages are a little bit –”</p>
<p>“Lloyd, we live in northern Haelcrien. No high tierers are coming up here.”</p>
<p>“...Fair enough.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s nice,” Dan said. “”</p>

<p>“Why don’t I get one?” Rosa asked.</p>
<p>“You did literally nothing except scream and get scratched,” I turned to look at her pointedly.</p>
<p>“And you, are a big meanie.”</p>
<p>“Aww, don’t worry Rosie,” Bia purred. “I’ll take ya out to murder a hamster later, aye?”</p>
<p>I shook my head with a laugh, then turned back to the competent one.</p>
<p>“We’ll set you up with a specialization ritual sometime later, yeah?”</p>
<p>“What’s that for again?”</p>
<p>I rolled my eyes. “Lloyd.”</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes too. “Ars, why me?”</p>
<p>“You’re the Governance lore guy,” I shrugged. “Makes sense.”</p>
<p>“Oh, come on, you know just as much.”</p>
<p>“And if I’m forced to explain it to specimens of this intellect I will have to kill myself.”</p>
<p>“Fine.” He dismissed his weapons. Dunno why he does that, he has sheaths. Actually, why have sheaths if his weapons are conjured??? “So, a specialization basically makes it so the abilities you manifest are all fine tuned to synergize with each other and have a cohesive theme. You can still gain abilities and rank up without one, but the power set gets disorganized and nothing works together.”</p>
<p>Dan gave a thumbs up.</p>
<p>“Right,” Rosa said slowly. “Got it. How d’you get abilities anyway?”</p>
<p>I slid a hand down my face. Sometimes I forget these two grew up here. </p>
<p>“By trying,” I started. “That includes actually killing something, which you’ve yet to –”</p>
<p>Thankfully, Lloyd has us covered.</p>
<p>“- learn about, so it’s perfectly reasonable to be terrible at it the first time around!” He smiles a grin as gilded as his hair. Not that his teeth are, uh, yellow. Just shiny. “You get abilities when you do something important, when you cross a monumental point in your life. Dan didn’t get one here because he killed the thing way too easily, and you’ll probably need more danger to manifest something.”</p>
<p>“<em>More</em> danger?” Rosa groaned.</p>
<p>“Or you could take the coward’s way out,” I said irritably. “Buy an ability manifestation off of someone, though it’ll be hells expensive if it’s anything at all specialized.”</p>
<p>“Y’know…” Rosa moved her eyes in a rare moment of thought. “I could take making dinner for another few months if it nets me fireballs.”</p>
<p>“I’m on board with that.” Dan said.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">***</p>

<p>Another few hours of travel later and the stars are dimming over stone walls in the distance. We’ve entered Haelcrien’s plains and you can see for kilometres in every direction – yet the lone impending shadow of Evedast is the only sign of civilization. It’s a miracle Haelcrien hasn’t been invaded by Carioneth yet. Our north is mostly uninhabited,low-tier land, and those fuckers are the most aggressive nation of the planet. If the Autumn Kingdom and it’s disproportionate population to ambient magic ratio wasn’t around, we’d’ve been conquered centuries ago.</p>
<p>Evedast fast approaches as the stars shy away. Vyne fruit orchards dotted with farmhouses wafted the smell of earth onto the path, as it transitioned from dirt and gravel to smooth stone-paved road.</p>
<p>“Will they even let us in at this hour?” Bia asked. Glad to see she was finally out of her area of expertise.</p>
<p>“Don’t know,” I shrugged. “I’ll bust the doors open if they don’t.”</p>
<p>“Oooh, careful around here,” Rosa sneered. “They might have actual competent adventurers in town.”</p>
<p>“No, doubt it,” I replied. “Monsters get scared off by the walls’ ritual inlays anyway, there’s no need. At most they’ll buy some monster parts from nomadic adventurers and they don’t come through often, it’s usually just merchants that bought the parts and carry them out here.”</p>
<p>“That’s still a chance…”</p>
<p>“Shut up, we’re here.”</p>
<p>Bia waved the hexacampi to an eerily synchronized stop before closed, impressive-looking gates. I hopped off and approached the door and gave it a knock. Interlocked ritual circles appeared on the wood in response to my touch, tendrils of glowing mist following. They tapped my fingers a few times and withdrew, satisfied. The doors swung open and closed behind us.</p>
<p>“Oooh, automatic,” Bia grinned. “Fancy. Maybe I should study ritual circles sometime.”</p>
<p>“Your work ethic wouldn’t let you, and you’d probably blow up the house too,” I said.</p>
<p>“Shut up.”</p>
<p>Bia and the Verosavs took the crabs to a stable while Lloyd and I went off to find a place to stay. I headed directly to the next ring-road as this one seemed to be residential. Commercial and residential rings usually alternated in the Governance’s city designs, with administrative sectors in the centre and other important buildings spread throughout.</p>
<p>Not many people were out this late, but the one man nearby seemed to heading directly towards us. Reddish hair, eyes, and beard, wearing an overextravagant sheriff’s hat and some manner of suit and combat robe mesh. Some manner of Presence too – Rosa was unintentionally right that there were high rankers in town. High rank meant either adventurer or nepobaby experience buyer, but incurred wariness regardless.</p>
<p>“Hello there!” said the man, waltzing over with hands in pockets. “Lost?”</p>
<p>“Not particularly,” I said. “Who are you?”</p>
<p>Lloyd pushed me back with an exasperated glare.</p>
<p>“Forgive my rude friend,” he said. “We’re doing fine, but thanks anyway. What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“You just said the same thing I did,” I told him.</p>
<p>“You are impolite.”</p>
<p>“I’m exactly what I intend to be.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry ‘bout that, I was just as bad when your parents were in school,” he chuckled.  “Well if ya looking for a place to stay, there’s a nice inn down the street. Dollar Dragon or something, good room service and cheap price for six of you people.”</p>
<p>“Right,” Lloyd said. “...but how did you know we needed an inn?”</p>
<p>“You’re adventurers,” he said. “And tier seven at that. Not common ‘round here.”</p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow. Being able to tell our exact rank meant either an even higher rank than the twenty-thirty that I’d guessed, or a ridiculous attribute point allotment to Soul.</p>
<p>“Far enough,” I supposed. “So, what’s your name? Kinda dodged the question.”</p>
<p>“You can call me… Arodorros.”</p>
<p>“Odd name,” I said. “You high society around here? Aristocracy, however much of that’s left?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, not around here. All the way from north Rueleva.”</p>
<p>“That’d be Dawne Kingdom territory. They don’t let people in nor out of that place. You can’t be from there.”</p>
<p>“Mhmm,” he shrugged.</p>
<p>“...Well, thank you for the advice,” I said. “See you around?”</p>
<p>“Certainly,” he smiled a little too genuinely, and walked off the exact direction he came.</p>
<p>I turned to Lloyd. “Stalker, d’you think?”</p>
<p>“Why would he stalk us?”</p>
<p>“Gods know. Maybe he really is from Dawne. The Unions don’t even know what those fuckers are up to, we certainly wouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“But… why us?”</p>
<p>“Might not be us. Some kind of generalized survey on Haelcrien adventurers or something.”</p>
<p>“I think you’re being a little stupid here,” Lloyd said.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Your hourglass.”</p>
<p>My eyes widened. “Fuuuck.”</p>
<p>“What’s with the darn hourglass anyway? And why won’t you just give it to Grim?”</p>
<p>“Well, god knows what Grim would do with it, and there’s no reason for it to keep its word and actually leave.”</p>
<p>“But it would’ve gotten you out without the whole breaking your ribs thing.”</p>
<p>“That’s… Lloyd, we can discuss this when we find a room and not the middle of a fucking public street.”</p>
