## Establishing Shots

[APPROACH plays]

**INT. TEMPLE**

Sun rays spill between large white marble columns, lighting an empty temple floor. In the centre is a small dais around a fountain. The EQUILIBRIUM stands apathetically on it.

ARI steps in.

**ARI**

Equilibrium.

**EQUILIBRIUM**

Hastor. Consider your options...

## Fight

[YOU’RE FREAKIN’ GROUNDED plays]

There’s a sudden blur, and Ari LEAPS forward, landing a flurry of strikes with a DAGGER. Purple flames SPIRAL AROUND Equilibrium, DASHING inward before it LIFTS ITS WINGS to block the next attack.

The Equilibrium RISES, spreading its arms and chanting.

**EQUILIBRIUM**

Fool.

(chanting indecipherable words)

Ari GRINS, and her dagger MORPHS into a greatsword, stabbing into the ground. Tendrils of RED LIGHTNING scissor outwards, wrapping around the pillars of the temple before SLICING through them. They WHIRL TOWARDS the Equilibrium as the roof of the temple collapses downwards.

**EQUILBRIUM – CONT’D**

(chanting indecipherable words)

The Equilibrium’s chant continues. With a wave of Ari’s hand, the debris of the roof and columns stops, red lightning encircling them. Shot of rocks floating slowly. Ari snaps fingers. The rocks form a swirling vortex above the temple. Each piece CHARGES toward the Equilibrium so fast the animation doesn’t even register their movements as they EXPLODE into dust on contact with the Equilibrium’s wings.

**EQUILBRIUM – CONT’D**

(chanting indecipherable words)

The dust freezes, each particle accelerating to ridiculous speeds to SLICE down and THROUGH Ari. Blood spurts in slow motion – literal slow motion as Ari rewinds time to reverse the attack. Shot of the hourglass twinkling. Ari TWIRLS out of the way of the particles as they SCISSOR through the floor. Ari continues dancing through the air a supersonic speed to avoid the particles, which are following her like a flock of birds.

**EQUILBRIUM – CONT’D**

(chanting indecipherable words)

Ari suddenly SPINS, turning towards the Equilibrium and charging, hands filled with red energy. The Equilibrium doesn’t bat a nonexistent eye, as a great shield appears in front of it. Ari stops in time, once more twirling around. The particles SLAM against the shield and stop dead.

**EQUILBRIUM – CONT’D**

(finish chanting indecipherable words)

The Equilibrium finishes its chant. It curls its fingers, and an orb of [] appears, expanding rapidly. It explodes, and for a second you can see the FIRMAMENT flashing before the temple and space around it TEARS APART. The matter twists into terrifying shapes, swirling and flashing as the Void enters reality.

[MATH & SCIENCE plays]

**EXT. AMIRLITH STRATOSPHERE – MIDDAY**

Equilibrium emerges from the dust and debris, looking into the aperture to the Void.

**ARI**

(playfully, spreads hands)

Hi.

Ari floats there, wings extended, unharmed. The Equilibrium tilts it’s head, about to speak before the Firmament flickers into view, undulating slowly. WHAM – an orderly ring of [] tendrils surface from the Void aperture and slam into it, knocking it backwards, circling Amirlith in seconds. Ari follows with a twist of her wings, shooting forwards like a cannonball as the Firmament FLASHES in the background. She arrives and COLLIDES feet first into the Equilibrium, before quickly SPINNING around and lacerating its face with red conjured claws. Gouges appear in its shimmering white head, the porcelain material flesh-like on the inside. Governance popups splash away from the Equilibrium.

**EXT. AMIRLITH CITY**

Ari and the Equilibrium PLOW THROUGH a series of towers, which promptly COLLAPSE behind them. They arrive on the street with a CRASH, leaving a crater as they immediately zoom back into the sky in a flurry of intense hand to hand combat. The Equilibrium has now morphed one of its hands into a long serrated blade, failing to hit Ari as she dashes around it tauntingly.

Ari reaches out a hand to the sky. Red tendrils EXTEND from her fingers, SHOOTING up to the sky. The firmament FLASHES, and the sky TURNS OFF. Portals to the Void OPEN UP across Amirlith’s sky. Capsules of [] emerge as the portals SNAP SHUT, the [] SHOOTING like bullets towards the Equilibrium, who barely manages to parry with its sword. The Firmament FLICKERS more.

Ari DASHES IN for another strike, but the Equilibrium throws up a hand and CONJURES a shield. Ari BOUNCES OFF, spinning about before realizing the Equilibrium has DISAPPEARED.

**POV SHOT**

[WHISPERS IN THE SKY plays]

Ari pans her vision about, seeing the Firmament as she looks for the Equilibrium. Her vision locks onto an object rapidly ascending into the sky.

**ARI**

(venomous)

Gotcha.

She plunges downwards and RICOCHETS back up out of the atmosphere. The entire sky SHAKES.

## Outro

Still shot. Ari and Equilibrium’s faces side by side, Ari’s hair whipping in the wind.
