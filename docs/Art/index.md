# Art

Housed here is all the art done for COA.

## Conventions

### Categories

Writing here come in two categories:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-wallpaper:{ .lg .middle } __OKAY NO MORE BS WHERES THE ART__

    ---

    All pictorial art, including illustrations and other assets. Don't know why'd you'd want more of this, but sure.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Gallery](Gallery/index.md)

-   :material-typewriter:{ .lg .middle } __can i has more nerdy stuff__

    ---

    Occasionally I will write scripts for larger animations which I will inevitably never finish. Here they are:
