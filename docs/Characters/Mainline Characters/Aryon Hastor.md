Stoic and efficient, Aryon gets shit done with the speed and precision of a machine - as long as she judges the attached caveats worth her time. For this reason, she's been sat around in a little backwater town instead of seeking glory - what more does an adventurer need past the expendable income? She and her sister Bia make bank selling monster parts and own a small house in said backwater and live a comfortable, albeit routine life.

Ari is, by the standards of her rank, an absolute prodigy in monster hunting - you'd be hard pressed to find someone tier seven that could stand toe to toe with her and her glass cannon power set. However, when a shadow demon of mass destruction shows up hangry in her forest, she's only able to escape by way of ancient family heirloom and her bloodline's reality-bending abilities. 

You barely reading-comprehended that last sentence, but the mysteries only deepen when she's saddled with the duty of defeating the interdimensional space rats currently invading her country. Her ill-fated mentor character quickly lore drops a bunch of weird shit like being descended from a deity and copious other confusions (what the heck does he mean 'Main Character'???). Even if she pulls off stopping the rat cultists, fate's still got plenty left to do before she can rest well.
