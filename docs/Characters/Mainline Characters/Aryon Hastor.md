## Character
### Personality

Sometimes acts mentally unstable but is quite stoic and no-nonsense whenever things get just a teeny bit serious. Internally utilitarian. Peaked in high school.

### Internal Conflict

Ari’s flaw is an unwillingness to take risks and a need to plan out everything beat by beat. She refuses to leave Javenshard and grow her career because this in itself would be a massive risk. Much safer to stay hidden here in a little backwater town, eternally stagnant. Due to lack of mentorship from her parents, she grew up insecure of her position. She risked a ton getting to where she is now and is scared of losing what she has. She still feels that she’s not good enough, not prepared and the correct person to be managing her business.

### History

Aryon was born in Aethereanil and moved to Troltano in Haelcrien when Duskir and Faelorn decided they didn’t want anything to do with Dawne. Then, later on, Aryon got good with adventuring and decided to pursue her hobby somewhere where the monsters weren’t as powerful and moved to Javenshard. Duskir came with her and Bia.
