## Character
### Personality

Unexpected and jovial, always laughing and joking. Gets concerned very easily and often anxious but knows how to hide it. Smart and empathetic, but sometimes irrationally quick to trust. A large lack of cynicism.

### Internal Conflict

Due to the constant formality and etiquette of her family, Bia grew up very rebellious and casual. She masks herself with an almost cartoonish persona, unable to stop cracking jokes and goofing around. She’s been doing this for so long that the mask has become a fundamental part of her. She doesn’t know how to relinquish it yet realizes that it’s wrong. She feels like she would only get attacked if she took it off, that the people she knows would reverse their attitudes at the reveal that she’s a complete and utter fraud.

### History

Bia was born in Aethereanil and moved to Troltano in Haelcrien when Duskir and Faelorn decided they didn’t want anything to do with Dawne. When her sister Aryon got into adventuring, Bia joined in not long after. After a little discussion, they decided to move to Javenshard, Bia because the weaker monsters would mean faster levelling and Ari because Javenshard was quiet and out of the way.
