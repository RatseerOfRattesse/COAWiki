Castell is the friendly face of the 'narrator duo,' at least to those close enough to Transcendence to know it. They are amiable, friendly, and soft-spoken, especially when put next to their counterpart Halos. Though often spotted with their glaive, it appears more of a ceremonial setpiece than anything used for battle - Castell is far more likely to offer you a cup of tea and an organized execution instead.

The Narrators' abilities are seemingly limitless, but they rarely employ their power so as to let the cosmos take its natural course of action. There is, of course, the fact that they seem to control where that course flows - but anyone not a nihilist would rather ignore that.
