Dan Verosaven is the poor child of the Verosavens and the more successful one anyway. As according to Haelcrien tradition, the then-broke Verosaven family named him with a glaring lack of syllables. His younger sister Rosalith was much more fortunate, mostly on account of Dan's academic prowess. Having worked eight years in the bigger cities as a magic research assistant, Dan knows little tidbits of magic theory - much more than you'd usually see in Javenshard. You'd be hard pressed to get any of that out of him however - he only seems to talk to chastise his sister and break up moments of awkward silence.
