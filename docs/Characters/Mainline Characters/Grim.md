Occupation: Engine of Change

Aliases: Demon, ‘Ah, holy shit, what the fuck is that?! Oh god, it’s getting closer, I can see reality peeling away like sloughing skin, I can feel the cold press of an endless void just beyond our own existence. It speaks to me in rhymes – we are all already in it’s grasp.’

Professional mass murderer Grim is always on the lookout for a new challenge, and they've found their newest target suitably entertaining. Aryon Hastor has the power to probably kill Grim, but is too stupid to know or try. Grim and the rest of the dysphorium don't seem to care for much but endless blood and death - suffering builds character, after all. The Engine of Change wants good character arcs, so Grim wants good character arcs, and gets that done the only way it knows how. Do NOT mess up its pronouns though. That will get them out of toying around mode and into straight for your vital organs mode.
