Hailon experienced an extradimensional invasion of his homeworld when he was younger - an extermination by the Akrilith Cult, with motives unknown. Having lost many important people then, he has since spent his life attempting to cheat death. Many of his experiments got nowhere, but the first that actually produced results summoned a threat that, once done with his universe, would soon be a problem for the entire cosmos.
