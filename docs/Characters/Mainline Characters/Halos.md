Halos is the Narrators' bad cop. They're abrasive, spiteful, hilarious, and all that sums up to be a bit of an asshole. Also violent! Do something they don't like and you'll quickly find yourself torn up and fried with the power of the narrative stack. Unlike their counterpart Castell, they fight (and eat) with their claws, and aren't averse to having some fun with their victims. Halos gets stuff bluntly done for the Narrative, while the level-headed Castell decides what need to be done.

The Narrators' abilities are seemingly limitless, but they rarely employ their power so as to let the cosmos take its natural course of action. There is, of course, the fact that they seem to control where that course flows - but any non-nihilist would rather ignore that.
