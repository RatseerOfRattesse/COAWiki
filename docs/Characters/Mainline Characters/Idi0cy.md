idi0cy.inc's arrival sparked the cosmos' existential crisis as their apparent invincibility and in-your-face fourth wall breaking was already bringing up questions about the nature of reality without their mention of 'the narrator.' All said, idi0cy doesn't seem to do much in the public eye except announce more and more ridiculous company products. From the few interviews he's taken part in, the people have surmised that he is a friend of the 'narrator' and somewhat of a 'narrator' himself. Thankfully, idi0cy.inc's arrival didn't cause much actual damage other than to the Amirlithic taskforces who failed to infiltrate their main base of operations, that being a massive cube that company employees adamantly spell as 'coob' instead of the correct spelling.
