## Character

### Personality

Tired and cynical of everything. He’s accomplished a lot, but it never seems to be enough.

### Internal Conflict

Krath wishes to become powerful. He saw much oppression and pain back in the Akral Sanctum. He’s just trying to become powerful enough that this is no longer an issue. Unfortunately, that’s not possible, so Krath has just had to settle with the fact that there is no avoiding hardship. He sees bullshit everywhere, doesn’t believe anything anyone says. And after joining [idi0cy.inc](../../Worldbuilding/Political%20Entities/idi0cy.inc.md) and learning about the nature of reality, he’s descended into nihilism. He hasn’t taken his insignificance as excuse to make his own meaning, and has instead taken it as excuse to give up.

### Thematic Relevance

Krath represents the argument for nihilism. In this universe, humans are so small. We mean nothing. We will never leave a significant mark on this realm. He’s a Viktor, getting stuck over and over and never really achieving what he was after. This is someone who’s given up, lost his resolve to improve and become more. He got to a place where he could resolve his issues, then failed to do it.

### History

Born to now-dead parents in the dictatorship of the Akral Sanctum, Krath is a genius who was able to reverse engineer Akral magic to use it without faith, instead powering it with the direct power of the soul. He jumped through various universes and jobs, where his genius was shamelessly exploited. He gained power enough to survive in the cosmos, but was constantly dodging between disasters until he found salvation in idi0cy.inc, who hired him to be one of their AI Assasinators.
