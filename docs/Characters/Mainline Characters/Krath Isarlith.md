Krath is a tired and cynical not that-old-man. No matter what he accomplishes, it's never enough - no silly mortal could take on an entire interdimensional faction. But he at least he tries anyway.

Krath wishes to become powerful. He saw much oppression and pain back in the Akral Sanctum and wants to change that. Unfortunately, that’s not possible in any reasonable time frame, so Krath has just had to settle with the fact that there is no avoiding hardship. He sees bullshit everywhere, doesn’t believe anything anyone says. And after joining [idi0cy.inc](../../Worldbuilding/Political%20Entities/idi0cy.inc.md) and learning about the nature of reality, he’s descended into nihilism and entirely given up on doing anything against the Akrilith. Quite a waste, considering what he's been able to do before.

His parents' deaths by Akral leadership once filled him with a thirst for vengeance. He developed incredible skill and understanding in firmament theory and was able to reverse engineer Akral energy to use it faithlessly. He never gained much recognition for this, however, his genius being exploited by all the odd magic research jobs he shuffled through. All the while he was hunted by the Akrilith, until he was hired by idi0cy.inc, who gave him refuge from the cultists, resources to continue his work, and a proper long term job.
