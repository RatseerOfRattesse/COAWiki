Lloyd was a member of Deliria's powerful House Limril, but has since been estranged from his family and their demanding standards. Though still carrying the burden of his family's academic berating, he's now taken up a career in adventuring that he's far more enthused with. Lloyd also does a side job with some... very not local people, but that's spoiler territory.

He is obsessed with making a change in the world and doing the right thing. Combined with some radical outside influence, and you get a pretty volatile guy. At least he fights really well.
