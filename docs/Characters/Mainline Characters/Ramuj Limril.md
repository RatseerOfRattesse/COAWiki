Ramuj is one of the crown sons of House Limril, and one of their smartest scions. He feverishly works at his magic research - specifically, the taboo field of soul magic. He tries to be ethical, but crosses some lines occasionally - which his family isn't as enthused about as his more publically palatable advances. When approached by a group of 'adventurers' looking for help with a mysterious object they discovered in the Autumn Kingdom, Ramuj's dead-end research is suddenly reignited with a wave of revelations. Dangerous revelations that could topple an empire, yes, but he's never cared about ethics before. Why should he now?
