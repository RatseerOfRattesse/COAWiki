Duskir was once one of the most promising scions of Aethereanil, before she and her fiancé Faelorn disappeared from the kingdom without a trace. After having her new adventuring team in Haelcrien dismantled by dysphorium for approaching something they shouldn't have seen, she's been in a near catatonic state of depression, alone in her cabin.
