Faelorn was once one of the most promising scions of the Hastor Dynasty, before he and his fiancé Duskir disappeared from the kingdom without a trace. After he and Duskir's adventuring team was massacred and he began having disconcerting visions, he's departed his family and hid in Troltano, apparently for their safety. Not that anyone believes that.
