## Prevailing Chaos

The inherent chaos of reality, of nature. No matter how regimented you may attempt to make it, chaos prevails. [The Great Immortals](../Worldbuilding/The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Metaphysical%20Beings.md), trying to keep the balance in a cosmos that needs chaos. [Ari](../Characters/Mainline%20Characters/Aryon%20Hastor.md), attempting to make a perfect riskless plan, inevitably being interrupted by the [Haelborne](../Worldbuilding/Political%20Entities/idi0cy.inc.md), the [Aethein](../Worldbuilding/Political%20Entities/Cult%20of%20the%20Aethein.md), [Dawne](../Worldbuilding/Realities/Kaaldenvale/Geography/Rueleva/Dawne%20Kingdom/index.md), [idi0cy.inc](../Worldbuilding/Political%20Entities/idi0cy.inc.md). Faith, Perseverance, Chaos, Ingenuity. Human traits of unpredictability and imperfection. The [soul](../Worldbuilding/The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Souls.md), an engine of change. To live is to be chaotic.

## What Does Not Define You

What, in the sense of ‘what you are’. Your form is simply a canvas for your soul to paint upon. You can make it whatever you want. Ari takes the divine power offered upon her and steals it, makes it anew. Creates. [The Precursors](../Worldbuilding/The%20Cosmos/Precursors.md) took the world built in front of them and spun it into a new creation, weaved the strings of fate for themselves and all else afterward. And so every being after defied their upbringings, made change for the sake of themselves and their ideals.

Existence and consciousness itself shows that we can be more than we were designed to be. So why not take advantage of that? Defy rules, make yourself what you think you should be. Listen to others, but consider their words and decide as you see fit. And become you.

## Balance

Hardship is a necessity of residence in the [Living Cosmos](../Worldbuilding/The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Living%20Cosmos.md). Chaos, eternal. But to be happy, one must make something of the world, make balance out of chaos. Happiness factors from challenge, and the fundamental challenge is maintaining the balance in the Chaos. The Precursors fighting for the next tomorrow. The Haelborne and the Cult of the Aethein fighting for their idea of balance, the [Elder Immortals](../Worldbuilding/The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Metaphysical%20Beings.md#the-elder-immortals) returned. The process for [transcendence](../Worldbuilding/The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Metaphysical%20Beings.md#transcendence) requires balance between body and soul. The best technology balances magic and technology. Balance is ideal, but ideals can’t be maintained all the time. The point of having them is to fight for them.

## Happiness in Creation

Chaos allows creation. Unregulated, unpredictable, infinite. Make something of yourself. Don’t stagnate in false belief of happiness. Ari wants to stay in [Javenshard](../Worldbuilding/Realities/Kaaldenvale/Geography/Eorwin/Haelcrien/Haequar/Javenshard.md), believing that her state of mind, her life, is fine. Inside, she is screaming at herself. Don’t overstep. Don’t be reckless. These are good instincts, if they weren’t followed to the point of zeal.

The Precursors built an empire, lived happy in the vision of the First Emperor. His ambition lived only in his own ideals. His successors pushed onward, took risks and paid the price, but truly lived for it. The soul, the engine of change, they exist for survival. But you, the gears of that engine, can create new things in that cause, or make that cause your own. If you can make yourself happier, do it. Reject the risks. But if you are happy, learn that it’s okay to live in —

## Satisfaction in Imperfection

Nothing is perfect and the pursuit of perfection dooms you to failure or revelation. Be satisfied with yourself. Learn to take what you have. Cease pursuit, cease conquest for any ideal but your own. The sheer power and magnitude of the cosmos, the drive of the Narrative, makes you seem so small, so insignificant. But that doesn’t matter. You can live regardless, in your own way, in appreciation of your life and the people around you.

This is what every character fails in all but the last parts of the story. Struggling to make their lives better in the belief that they don’t already have what they need. Assuring themselves happy at a point of artificiality and stagnance. This is why transcendence requires the reconciliation of self, to relinquish self doubt and the errors of consciousness.

## The Big Picture
Looking out into the infinite, into the wellbeing of the cause, only creates destruction. A cause is good. It anchors your values, allows you to accomplish and create goals. But you must put your ultimate faith in people, in individuals, not groups, because groups warp and change their original intentions, and can’t be trusted. Make friends, not allies. Those who motivated themselves first by some grand cause incurred only destruction. The Precursors, the Haelborne. They only created net negatives. It’s only when our characters focus on each other, being out for love vs out for blood, that they get everything right, find the strength within themselves to do what needs to be done.

## Characters

### Ari and Bia

*Change and Stagnance*

Ari stagnates in Javenshard, telling herself that she’s satisfied and venerating her overzealous principles. Further along this path, she would have lived her entire life unsatisfied. The Haelborne change that, forcing her out of her comfort zone. She tries to go back, refuses to cooperate until she ends up taking [Arodorros](../Characters/Side%20Characters/Arodorros%20Nayirah.md)’ quest. Not because no one else can, but because she can’t bear to place the fate of [Kaaldenvale](../Worldbuilding/Realities/Kaaldenvale/index.md) in Bia’s hands.

As Ari slowly descends into madness, [Bia](../Characters/Mainline%20Characters/Biaphon%20Hastor.md) does all she can to help. She makes some headway, sets Ari on a journey to figuring out herself, but now that it’s started, Bia is scared that her sister will screw up and inserts herself to an unhealthy degree attempting to fix everything. She only strains their relationship instead. Bia also has to force away the naivety she blanketed over herself to avoid seeing the world the way it is. She’s delusional, using the subjectivity of consciousness to warp what she sees.

Bia puts up her mask as a defence mechanism against her family. As the book goes on, Bia’s stress starts letting the mask go. But Ari’s nearby extremeness allows her to wake up, to continue try and hold herself together.

Ari’s stagnation sprouts from her risk-free ideals. She refuses to take risks in fear that something will tip her from the good position she is in. She has reached the first plateau of the mountain and fears falling back down. She doesn’t go new places, doesn’t form new relationships, doesn’t let her current ones develop. This infiltrates her mindset and makes it so she wants to meticulously plan out every single thing, but she soon learns that isn’t possible. She even despises Bia for her ‘laxness.’ She subconsciously avoids Lloyd’s invitations because of it as well. Slowly she has to learn that you have to take risks in life. That’s what makes it worth living.

Playing into the last theme, chaos intercedes into all parts of life. Risks and unpredictability are inherent and required. But Ari ends up taking that to the edge of its practicality, letting her utilitarian side out and becoming a ruthless piece of shit. This pulls her relationships into a detrimental space and only Bia figuring herself out and helping in a good way gets her out. Even so, she still fails to fix her biggest issue – a fixation on the past, on returning things to how they used to be. She now knows she must do greater deeds to get there, but it’s still that same point regardless. Her arrow wants to be a circle.

Change is necessary. It fuels the cosmos, gives life substance. Life is not worth living without the ability to create new things. Ari is anti-progress, the force of stagnation. Everything she does in the first half of the story is in aid of keeping the status quo. She doesn’t want to take her role as the Aethein. She works with the Great Immortals not in loyalty to them but in hope that she can rid the cosmos of the Haelborne, return it to stagnance. She tries to stay with Bia as their relationship strains, but just makes everything worse because Bia won’t recognize what she’s become. That’s when she decides to change something. She goes to Bia herself, instigates a change for once, and they fix their relationship together. Connection continues another monstrous cycle, creates empowerment, and we can move on.

At this midpoint of the story, at the end of arc four, she has rejected her old ideals. She finalizes herself, a new paragon of power. She stops trying to reject the ascension of the helix and instead weaponizes it into a straight, diagonal line, efficiently travelling on both axes, pushing through everything thrown her way. She sees her mistakes, the wrongs she wrought, and some kind of moral compass awakes in her and she decides to rebuild what she destroyed, and to destroy those who sowed the seeds of this destruction. Her new challenge is not to go too far, not to drive her ambition out of orbit and be lost formless in the vacuum. She must now reconcile herself and her flaws. That starts with ditching the Great Immortals.

Ari is once more able to utilize the resourcefulness that once made her a great adventurer. This allows her to take what the big high-ups give her and spin bullshit out the other end. Reusing things beyond their intended purposes to scheme and turn other people’s schemes on their heads. She even weaponizes the helix, as previously mentioned.

And so Ari begins her journey of self recovery, but her task doesn’t make it easy. She must avoid the agents of the Immortals, mysterious, stealthy, and unpredictable. A nebulous threat that won’t show anything but the tip of its blade. She constantly complains that, for all her power, she can do nothing. She comes out victorious time and again, but losing more and more of herself as she goes.

Her reconciliation begins with seeking answers. She takes up idi0cy.inc and the Cult of the Aethein, listening to what they have to say. She agrees to meet with the Narrator, in order to find out how she could possibly fix this mess she has created – only to find that he is not the wise being she thought. He has no more experience than she does, and cannot simply give her the answers. He does offer a deal, to keep Ari in line, help her make sure she doesn’t slip again. A leash, of sorts. Lloyd. In return for exerting justice and restoring the cosmos, she can have Lloyd back.

Newly motivated, Ari sets out to do what must be done. This new hope has granted her solace and a goal, but also a new burden. What is she to say to her friends, if she fails? She decides it best not to tell them, not even Bia.

As they continue on in their journey, Bia attempts to find out what Ari is hiding. Keeping secrets isn’t healthy, she thinks. In the process, she begins to slip. Becomes controlling, demanding, the lasting spite from her days giving and not receiving with her sister.  She can’t recognize herself, an angry nervous wreck lashing out at the smallest transgression. This, coupled with the new secrets after the two had supposedly come back together, ends up breaking her.
Ari tries to help, but after consistent rebuttal she gives up. She’s not an empath.  She doesn’t understand how people work, she can only read their surfaces and deduce a response, like a machine. This tension goes on for a while.

One of the dying worlds they must restore ends up being Kaaldenvale. They arrive, and come across the ruins of Javenshard. [Duskir](../Characters/Side%20Characters/Duskir%20Hastor.md), lying catatonic in her cabin. Everything is ruined, decayed, abandoned. The life they once had is gone now – they’ve moved on. And Bia begins to have regrets. If she hadn’t pushed Ari out of Javenshard, would any of this have happened? But then Ari comforts her, finds that lone speck of empathy in her genes. And Bia remembers her people, her sister, her friends, those she so enjoyed being with.

If they could go into the past and change things, they would. They would be wiser, make the right decisions that would allow them a balance in life, without the lessons they had to learn in blood. But they can’t. So they must look to the future, and make do with what they have. Bia finally forgives Ari, and Ari forgives her. And they sail off into the sunset, ready to confront the Great Immortals for the final time.

### Lloyd

*Future and Present*

Due to his short amount of screentime, [Lloyd](../Characters/Mainline%20Characters/Lloyden%20Limril.md) is less a character and more a symbol. He represents what Ari loses, a person who has already gone too far, already strayed off his path. He has found a cause, something to strain against. But he’s a Precursor, an Avsohmic, a Haelborne. An extremist.

When the story starts, his two identities are fighting each other. He’s barely eighteen, and has to reconcile the two sides of his now-clashing values. One is his ideology. He is all about justice, about righting wrongs, serving punishment to the guilty. The other is his value in people, in his relationships and loyalty. His first solution is to appeal to his ideology. After all, aiding the cause of the Haelborne will have a larger impact, right? It’s the right thing to do. It’s for the greater good.

But he can’t quite let his friends go. More specifically, he can’t let Ari go. Suddenly, he loves her. ‘So tell me, when did you, become my everything?’ What is he supposed to do when hormones and values and faith all come together in a mesh of bloody, visceral soup?

This conflict strains at him for the entirety of AOH. He tries to find a solution, and he decides that faith must prevail. He starts to doubt the Haelborne, but, they’re so much more powerful than he is. They know better. And he is supposed to do this! This is his responsibility, as a cog in the machine.

So he resolves to take the time he has with Ari and make something out of it. He wants to connect before he has to destroy their relationship forever. He fails. [Troltano](../Worldbuilding/Realities/Kaaldenvale/Geography/Eorwin/Haelcrien/Haequar/Troltano.md) comes too soon. Ari is too stagnant. Faith is more important than his needs.

Then he meets with Ari one final time. Looks at his priorities, and tries to fix everything. He can do both! But Ari sees his faith and rejects his apology, goes all the way. Preserving the status quo. She sees it as a trade-off. No more Haelborne, and she gets to keep everyone else together. Accepting Lloyd means joining the Haelborne, betraying her world. The cause is more important, she says, and believes it so much more thoroughly than Lloyd does, because she thinks in numbers and logic gates, and she kills Lloyd because it’s an overall better deal.

But Lloyd’s journey doesn’t end with his death. Lloyd’s soul arrives in front of [the Narrator](../Characters/Mainline%20Characters/Narrator.md), to be judged. And he pleads – ‘Let me see the end of our story. Let me have closure.’ And the Narrator just goes ‘Sure! It’s meant to be :)’ So he watches the entire time, and learns all the lessons that Ari and Bia do. It all starts to make sense, and when he finally reunites with Ari after all this time, he thanks her, for all the lessons he has learned. And the past, though tragic, was necessary. Maybe there was a better way to do things, but that doesn’t matter, because it didn’t go that way. So Lloyd turns away from his ideology of the greater good, of the great future to come, and lives in the present.

### Rosa and Dan

*Control and Neglect*

The Verosavens are the innocent bystanders of the story. They come along on Ari and Bia’s trip thinking it would be a fun vacation, but it quickly becomes a nightmare. Everything falls apart, the two of them now caught in a mess that they physically can’t fully comprehend. But it has given them one thing: the ability to fight for their fate.

[Dan](../Characters/Mainline%20Characters/Dan%20Verosaven.md) doesn’t like how things have gone. He would have preferred to simply live in Javenshard, happy and content. He was already at a good place. Then Bia came along, and it’s all madness now. To avoid assigning blame to anyone, he mires himself in apathy, does what needs to be done in pretense of everything being fine.

[Rosa](../Characters/Mainline%20Characters/Rosalith%20Verosaven.md)revels in power and opportunity, advances through the tiers no matter what stands in her way. Her life becomes a straight arrow upward; she disassociates from Ari and Bia’s drama, barging through every obstacle and throwing the ones that get to her in the closet. Lloyd is dead, Javenshard is probably burnt to the ground. But Rosa keeps going.

To further distance herself, Rosalie begins taking a leadership role over the group while Ari and Bia bicker up a cyclone. She tries to keep everything together, but no one else seems interested – except for Ari, who is the actual leader of their expedition, but she thinks like Siri Keeton. Rosa feels like she’s the only one carrying the slack – until she meets [Ramuj](../Characters/Mainline%20Characters/Ramuj%20Limril.md). He wants justice for his cousin, and knowledge for himself. He’s there to chronicle everything, and so he and Rosa both enthusiastically administrate and log their adventures. The two of them lead the trip like a pair of drunk drivers in charge of a bus.

Meanwhile, Dan is struggling to keep up his mask of apathy. This situation just gets more and more dire and he doesn’t know what to do about it. He doesn’t like how Rosa is managing things – she and Ramuj are reckless, diving headfirst into the next challenge over and over. But he keeps silent for now.

Rosa is worried about Dan. She’s not the most insightful, but she can certainly tell that something is wrong. But she doesn’t bring it up. She’s despising Ari and Bia for their continued bickering, and doesn’t want to risk bringing more of that into the group dynamic. So she leaves it be.

As the story progresses, Dan grows more and more cynical and neglectful, and Rosa buries away more and more memories. This tension can’t be allowed to continue.

Ari and Bia resolve their differences, and this is a wake up call for Rosa. If those two weirdos are over it, why isn’t she? So she goes to Dan and instigates a conversation. It doesn’t go well. They’ve been ignoring each other this entire time and now Rosa wants to try and fix things, as if she’s ever given a shit? And has Dan, either?

They storm away from each other, and spend the rest of the trip distanced. They both focus on getting stronger. Something mindless and repetitive to pretend is working. All they need is a little space, of course.

But neglect has never worked. They keep going in tension until – they return to Kaaldenvale. The group arrives in the Dawne Kingdom, smoking and decayed. The result of neglecting what needed to be done in favour of gaining power. And they see a parallel – isn’t this exactly what they’re doing?

So finally Dan acts, does the right thing and tries to reconcile with Rosa. She agrees.

### Ramuj
*Passion and Temperance*

Ramuj is a brilliant man. He’s a pioneer of [aura mechanics](../Worldbuilding/The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Aura%20Mechanics.md), but also entitled and naive. Growing up in a noble household, he’s always had life go his way; it’s always been an arrow straight up. Until he hits a wall. And that wall is the soul. He’s trying to look into soul manipulation, find out some way that people can remake themselves. He’s found ways to monitor the soul, ways to talk to it. But he can’t figure out how to open it. Ramuj neglects his family, feverishly investigating this new subject.

And then he meets the group, looking through [Delirian](../Worldbuilding/Realities/Kaaldenvale/Geography/Deliran%20Isles/index.md) archives just as he is. Their discovery and their project interests him, so he decides it healthy to abandon the soul project for the moment, and see where this new wind takes him. But then he hears their story, and realizes that they have been embroiled in something bigger than Kaaldenvale. And what better way to advance science than to take it from those outside the boundary of their reality?

So he joins them, and begins attempting to rank up as well so that he’s ready to face the challenges in this new path. He’s driven and full of resolve, and now that arrow is going back straight up and it won’t stop. He pushes into every new challenge with enthusiasm.

Then Deliria gets taken. His hometown, his family, all eradicated by the Haelborne. And he wakes up – he’s hit another wall. He realizes what he’s done by pushing away his loved ones in favour of his science, and he slows down. There’s nothing he can do about the people he lost, so he resolves to prioritize people before science. He forms closer relationships with the rest of the group, especially a friendship with Rosa, and becomes integral in holding them all together. He takes a moment to let the line become a helix.

And then they go off into the cosmos and ohmygodwhatthefuck he’s off again. He meets [Krath](../Characters/Mainline%20Characters/Krath%20Isarlith.md). Interdimensional knowledge surrounds him everywhere and he dives right back into science, right as the group needs him the most, as Ari and Bia are reaching the height of their tension. And Rosa joins him in neglect, simply more aware of it than he is.

So the two diverge from the others to pursue their own goals, but Ramuj notices something is wrong with Rosa, yet pays it no mind. He’s losing what he resolved to do in Dawne, but he doesn’t notice, until Ari and Bia fix themselves – and Rosa and Dan crash. He realizes he’s fucked up again. He apologizes to Rosa for ignoring her, but now she’s ignoring him like she is everyone else.

So, being socially stupid, he just waits it out, observes the group as they all try and fix their flaws. And it works out in the end.


## Symbolism
### Ari’s Paintings

Ari makes a lot of paintings. As the story progresses, they should begin to look outward. Start with home, things that make sense. Friends, buildings, trees. No fiction. As Ari begins to leave behind stagnance, open up the topics more. Places other than Javenshard, people she’s not familiar with. Eventually, she can start making shit up.

### Dysphorium

[Dysphorium](../Worldbuilding/Political%20Entities/Dysphorium.md) are symbols of change’s inevitability. They were produced due to an effort to create stagnation; to revert to the status quo — but of course, that didn’t work out. Change is inexorable and the attempt to stop it can only do harm. Now that they are wild and free, the Engine of Change entrusts them to carry the punishment of delaying its duty.

To those weak of will, they destroy without mercy. A soul that only flows with entropy is useless to the cosmos. To those with untapped potential, they taunt and play. Leave a little leeway so that escapees may be taught a lesson.

### Duskir and Faelorn

Minds only truly break when they see the true nature of the cosmos and their own insignificance, and when they are too fearful to accept it. And to those with the resolve to hold on, but too much fear to continue living, they become neglectful, apathetic. Duskir and [Faelorn](../Characters/Side%20Characters/Faelorn%20Hastor.md) are symbols of fear. They were what Ari would have become if she didn’t have her resolve.

### Raelia

[Raelia](../Characters/Mainline%20Characters/Raelia%20Hastor.md) represents spite. She wants the Immortals dead not because of what they did but the fact that they went against her. Her entire history on Kaaldenvale centres on preparing to do what she thinks justice.

### The Narrator

The Narrator represents absurdism; lack of obsession. It and its agents in the Cult of the Aethein all share this; they are content to simply live their lives, pursue their goals when they want to. Of course, human error affects us all, but this is the closest they can get.

### idi0cy.inc

idi0cy.inc represents absurdity. Wherever they’re found, there’s bound to be weird shit.
