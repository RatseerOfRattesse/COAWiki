???+ tip

    I recommend using [this PDF](https://file.garden/Zi28N2lFSSn-KxkR/coa/COA%20I%20-%20Advent%20of%20the%20Haelborne.pdf) version instead of this article - it is more polished and the PDF format allows me to make it more visually appealing.

???+ tip
    
    I also recommend reading the ability descriptions, but if you're not into that stuff, just skim it over and you'll be fine. Maybe.

???+ warning
