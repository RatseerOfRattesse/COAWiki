# Mainline Story

These are the main books that will compromise the book series whenever I'm done. Obviously, these are fully canonized. Each book has one prologue and epilogue chapter as well as regular chapters and an index of various LitRPG elements.

## Book I: Advent of the Haelborne

Aryon Hastor desperately wants to just live a normal adventurer's life, earning normal adventurer income and killing normal adventurer monsters. Unfortunately for her, the not-so-local interdimensional space rats want to harvest the very code of her world itself. With her country's adventurer force entirely compromised or incapable, no one is up to the task of stopping them.

    Trying out a comic version of the story after I realized that might suit it better. Updates will be infrequent and this is a side project.

    PDF Edition for portable use. Formatted using Google Docs into a much more 'traditional book' format.
