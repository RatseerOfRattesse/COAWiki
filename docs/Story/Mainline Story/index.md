# Mainline Story

These are the main books that will compromise the book series whenever I'm done. Obviously, these are fully canonized. Each book has one prologue and epilogue chapter as well as regular chapters and an index of various LitRPG elements.

## Book I: Advent of the Haelborne

Aryon Hastor desperately wants to just live a normal adventurer's life, earning normal adventurer income and killing normal adventurer monsters. Unfortunately, some interdimensional space rats want to harvest the local fabric of reality itself, and no one else is up to the task of stopping them.
