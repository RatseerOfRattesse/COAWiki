    ONE MORE PAGE I SWEAR. I'M NOT OBSESSED WITH ORGANIZATION. These are the main books that will compromise the book series whenever I'm done. Obviously, these are fully canonized. Each book has one prologue and epilogue chapter as well as regular chapters and an index of various LitRPG elements.

    There's some short stories here I suppose. These stories are not locked to the main plot and serve to flesh out other elements of the world or simply random ideas. Their canonicity is specified per page.
