## Governance

The Absolutionist leadership is just as secretive as everything else. From snippets of conversations with Absolutionists, it’s known that they are ruled by a small council of their most powerful people - the type of power that can level countries.

## Motives

They're rumoured to worship some sort of Immortal-esque figure - perhaps a minor Immortal - though still believe in the Immortals themselves, hence the religious connotations to their name. Why they use "Absolutionists" is still a mystery. Their publicly visible members - typically individuals with high personal power or something to compensate for a lack of it - often roam about the cosmos performing somewhat random tasks, purportedly "in aid of the Faith."

## Population

The Absolutionists are mostly composed of a civilian population that stays nestled away in their territory. The realities these populations belong to were mostly ruled by one or few extremely powerful individuals, who registered their worlds as well as themselves to the Absolutionist faction. Rumours of rights violations and dystopian conditions are floating around, but of course nobody actually investigates.
Only a fraction of their number venture outside their territory, and all such instances were expeditions hosting very powerful individuals on missions to various areas of the cosmos. These individuals, when interviewed, said that even the civilian population of their worlds had a very high standard for personal power. This is the only reason that the Absolutionists are considered a major faction; they would be very dangerous to fight if their people were telling the truth.

## Relations

The Absolutionists are as peaceful as their deity. They will alternately make friends and enemies as it serves their purposes. Most factions simply view them less like another faction and more just an individual roaming around. They don’t pay them much mind. On the other side of the coin, some factions view them as incredibly dangerous, usually factions that venerated Immortal entities similar to the Absolutionists’ deity.

## Specialties

Absolutionists’ abilities are powerful and varied. They do not usually trend towards a theme, though most don’t like to make use of methods that cause a mess.

## Territory

The Absolutionists are quite a minority and wouldn't be considered one of the big six if not for the amount of powerful figures constituting them. They control about 2600 realities and a large amount of world-sized dimensional ships. They have embassies in various other territories that they operate out of. Each of these are under heavy watch.
