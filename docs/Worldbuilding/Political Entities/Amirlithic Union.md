## Governance

Organized society between realities is commanded by a massive interworld council, with representatives from all realities that have discovered the nature of the cosmos. Their communication methods are far more advanced than what humans can comprehend, allowing the effective correspondence between so many parties.

## Motives



## Population



## Relations

Aside from the interworld council there are smaller societies with different leaderships structures. They stay out of Amirlithâ€™s way.

## Specialties



## Territory

The council is housed from the capital of the cosmos, an artificial full-universe sized reality called Amirlith. Within Amirlith are smaller, planet-sized cities. There are plenty of people living here, all immigrated from other realities. As Amirlith is an artificial world, no natural species were created.
