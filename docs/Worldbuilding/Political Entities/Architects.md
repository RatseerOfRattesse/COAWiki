## Specialties

The Architects are the forerunners in interdimensional travel and technology. However, their total population is far larger than their inferred from their reality count. The Architects' specialty is the creation of dimensional vessels of all types, most of which are residential mini-realities which house much of their population. Other than this, they have manufactured researched bases for the Daethai, war machines for the Verion, basic transport vessels for all, and even a few peculiar jobs with the Absolutionists. Their total fleet is incomprehensibly large, adding more than 12 million realities worth of people to their population.

## Territory

They are a faction of a meagre 4700 realities, but host another eight million realities worth of people in their dimensional vessels.
