## Governance

Every reality in the Criodun has elect a leader, to run in the completely randomized election of the Criodun's twelve-person council. The elections run every cosmic year, to ensure that no leader tries to abuse their power- not that they could do much. Out of 16 million realities, there's bound to be somebody unhappy with an abusive leader. Itâ€™s an authoritarian government, where the military might of every reality is the backing power. If the council stays good, they get to stick around.

## Motives



## Population

The Criodun are the largest of the six and take their name from the universe of their founder. They band together for protection and trade, hosting a total membership of about 16 million realities.

## Relations

As a whole, they stay out of inter-alliance conflicts but aren't above some petty infighting.

## Territory
