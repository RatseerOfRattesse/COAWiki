## Governance

Authoritarian theocracy.

## Motives

The Aethein is an ancient symbol once used throughout the cosmos but lost over time. Nobody knows exactly what it symbolized, except the very few remaining followers of its occult.
The Cult of the Aethein is an interdimensional society consisting of believers from all across the cosmos. They venerate the Aethein as an entity, though none know exactly what it is.
The entity is prophesized to be the descendant of something analogous to a fallen angel, a being cast from the ranks of its divine brethren (hmmm, I wonder who that could possibly be). It must have the unadulterated power of reality in its veins, have the power to manipulate the physical and spiritual realms at will.
The Cult believes that the Aethein is capable of restoring the reign of the so-called predecessor immortals. Unlike the Haelborne, they do not take direct action against the Great Immortals, but instead take any risk to find the Aethein and aid it in its conquest to restore the predecessors.

## Population



## Relations

The Haelborne and the Aethein are not antagonistic to each other - they have the same goal, though one is just a lot more radical than the other.

## Specialties



## Territory

The Cult is a minor interdimensional faction. They donâ€™t own any realities or pilot any major dimensional vessel bases. They gather in country-size chunks of physical realities, ignoring any activity from the rest of their reality.
