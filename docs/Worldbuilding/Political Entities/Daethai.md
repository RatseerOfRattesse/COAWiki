## Specialties

The Daethai are the mostly scholarly of the six factions .

## Territory

They encompass 16 million realities. They operate from many dimensional vessel bases within their region of influence and some in other regions they have a treaty with. These are research bases, home to teams that are sent out across the cosmos to collect any and all information about absolutely everything. Most of the faction's members aren't actually involved in the research process, instead realities who have offered resources to the effort in return for certain benefits and services.
