## Governance

None. Every dysphorium for themselves.

## Motives

Dysphorium are brought into being by other dysphorium in the Shattered Chapel in [Diorvana](../Realities/Diorvana/index.md). The result of the [Great Inventor](../Realities/Diorvana/History.md)â€™s failed attempt at resurrection. Because of the flawed nature of his method, it bypassed the usual limits a [soul](../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Souls.md) places on itself when entering a body. Without these limits, the soul can exert all the power it wants and annihilate its vessel. But in moderation, this can allow the vessel to perform impossible feats.

Most dysphorium are aggressive and sadistic, purely because the first one was. It proceeded to summon more of its kind, but only specific souls that had its preferred characteristics.


## Biology

Dysphorium do not have set bodies, though they usually trend towards preserved flesh macabrely meshed with metal. There is no biology to be had, as their entire animating force uses no organs and the pure power of the soul - because of this, they have [reality bending](../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Reality%20Bending.md) capabilities, but severely limited due to a physical body.

## Relations


## Specialties



## Territory

The dysphorium do not attempt to hold territory and instead run around the cosmos slaughtering everything they can get their hands on.
