## Governance

Authoritarian theocracy.

## Motives

The Haelborne are a civilization of sentient humanoid rats that strip-mine universes just like the Immortals, in their own quest to achieve transcendency and use that to overthrow the Immortals and bring back the original ten. They are a theocracy ruled by the Rat Lords as their High Priests and worship the ten original Immortals, to which the Rat Lords are said to be messengers.
But it’s all a big ruse. The Haelborne were created by the Six as an alternate means of acquiring reality fabric, left to run wild and believing they are truly aiding the cause of the original immortals. The chief Rat Lord is actually a plant left by the Immortals who gives them the results of the fabric-mining. Include a moment somewhere when the Haelborne are approaching their goal and are thwarted by a traitorous Rat Lord.

## Plan
Retrieve the Glass as a divine catalyst to destroy the Fundament Governance, heavily weakening Dawne and opening the kingdom to invasion. They need to invade the kingdom for a chance to take more of the remnant Immortal artifacts located there as well as capture the weakened Chaos for possible inside information.
However, the Glass requires Ari to willingly relinquish it- which she won't, as it's a very important family heirloom that she's been warned not to give up at all costs. Given that the dysphorium couldn't intimidate her into giving up the Glass, so they've got to leverage her into giving it- with hostages.
Conveniently, Lloyd is friends with Ari and also a Haelborne member.
The true reason they need the Firmament Glass is because the Five Immortals have been attempting to accrue all surviving remnants of the Elder Immortals, to abolish any hope of their return.

## Population



## Relations

The Haelborne had infiltrated Kaaldenvale long before AOH. They used various mystical methods to influence fae, building up a cult long before they arrived. Usually they would just waltz down and bust heads, but this time was a special mission and required finesse and reconnaissance. Ancient cultists grew dynasties that integrated into governments, set up arrival sites, and limited the metaphysical discoveries of faevinity.

## Specialties

Haelborne possess an aura that incur the respect of all mortal beings around them.

## Territory

The holy city of Rattesse is one of the Haelborne’s many dimensional vessels, and it is their capital city.
