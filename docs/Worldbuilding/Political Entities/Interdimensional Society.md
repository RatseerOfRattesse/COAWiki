## Governments
There are many challenges that come with running a [reality-spanning](../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory) empire. Different races have different moral values, different worlds have different environments. It’s a complicated affair, which sees a few archetypal forms of government emerge as the most successful.

## Proxy Governments
Proxy governments are the most common type found in interdimensional society, and usually in large-scale enclaves. Many other governmental systems have this in some form. These function by having multiple levels of government that get more specific in accordance to their scale. The top level will administer general rules and manage interactions with other groups, while a reality-sized level may have specific country-style laws in accordance to the needs of their population.

This system accommodates all species needs while still maintaining the society as a unified groups.

## Asomatous Governments
An asomatous government is based on another power structure but maintains little large-scale presence. They generally have large backers, such as an ancestral founder off gallivanting across the cosmos — but still conveniently able to bash some unworthy heads when needed.

This powerful backing entity replaces all but the menial tasks of the top level, representing the society in negotiations and showing up to reinforce the decision makers when needed. The amount of these backing entities increases according to the scale of the state.

## Authoritarian Governments
These governments rule with an iron fist. Absolute power over people however, still requires genuine absolute power. Most of these are small scale enclaves, as such power is hard to maintain when you’re stretched too thin. Large scale autocracies are always backed by some higher power, whether a Great Immortal, a legendary group of extremely powerful people, or even [the Narrator](../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Authority.md).

## Hive Governments
In societies spanning millions of realities, it’s incredibly difficult to make sure every voice is heard. Some (very few) societies have attempted to make this possible using massive councils and hive mind technology. This has worked on the smaller end of the interdimensional society spectrum, and is a slowly emerging phenomenon in higher circles.
