## Governance



## Motives



## Population



## Relations

The Verion are a warmongering species. Despite their warlike nature, they rarely wage wars on worlds populated with intelligent life- after being heavily punished by the authorities in Amirlith, that is.

## Specialties



## Territory

They originate from the reality of Tesseira. They take realities populated with unintelligent or no life, and are now in possession of 3 million realities, over too many years of conquest to count. Each of these worlds are now part of their vast empire, with the Verion adding their complex infrastructure to all of them. However, they do make a point of preserving what unintelligent life exists on the victims of their colonization.
