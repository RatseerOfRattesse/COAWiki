## Specialties

idiocy.inc is a scientific institution and product manufacturer operating on the multiversal scale. They produce various products and perform research and operate within Amirlithic voidspace.
Their source of funding is unknown because their sales aren’t very profitable. Word on the voidway is that this comes from a covert money-laundering operation. To avoid their economic crisis, they abolished debt and are somehow still afloat.
idiocy.inc has incredibly advanced technology, but often fail to utilize it properly. Other societies are vying for their technology, but all their stuff is closed-source. Due to the experiments that created this technology, idiocy.inc voidspace and surrounding voidspace is extremely volatile. A lot of unidentified metaphysical debris surrounds it, along with many punctured realities.
They sent an idea to the higher narrative plane to tell a friend of the writer (Kayden Zhou) to tell the writer (Ethan Tang) to make them exist. Hence, idiocy.inc now exists.
### Door Dimension
idiocy.inc has invented a series of doors that send themselves to another dimension when opened. There are a limited amount of doors, so you have to wait in a queue for your door to come back.
### Interconnection Cube
The interconnection cube is a cube invented by idiocy.inc and is currently the fastest way to communicate through dimensional barriers – if you know what you’re doing. The interface is needlessly complicated and only skilled users of the cube are capable of using it to its full speed.
### Purchase Screen
idiocy.inc sells a screen that can be used to order any of their products with instantaneous delivery time. How it does this is by reformatting its own matter into whatever product is requested. Therefore, it's a one use item.
### Relocation Cube
The relocation cube is a cube that can teleport you anywhere within the local reality - but only into walls. This would occasionally cause the user to phase into the Void, which is of course very useful. However, after learning of this use, idiocy.inc stopped distributing them, and there are now only three relocation cubes not in idiocy.inc's possession.
