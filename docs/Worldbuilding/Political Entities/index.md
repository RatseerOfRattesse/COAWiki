-   __But before we begin, how do big societies like this work?__

    ---

    With duct tape. It's duct tape. Always has been. More details can be found here!

-   __Point me to the nearest cluster of edgy religious weirdos.__

    ---

    Right this way sir! The Absolutionists are the ultimate edgelords of the cosmos. Who are they? No idea! What are their motives? No idea! They're very mysterious !11!!

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Absolutionists](Absolutionists.md)

-   __Take me to the manager. The manager of the cosmos, of course.__

    ---

    Uh, well the real managers are kind of super-deities from beyond existence... here, I'll take you to the bozos frolicking on the beach and pretending to be powerful instead.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Amirlithic Union](Amirlithic%20Union.md)

-   __I'm a creative person and want to meet people that can relate to my trauma.__

    ---

    Oh hey! Me too, but I'm antisocial. You can speak to these fictional guys that I made up who build shit for a living. The Architects are all about building... and nothing else.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Architects](Architects.md)

-   __Is there a Switzerland equivalent in the multiverse?__

    ---

    Yep. No lazy worldbuilding here. What was that? I can't hear it over just how peaceful and rich and neutral the Arithine are! Also, why do so many of these start with A?

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Arithine](Arithine.md)

-   __I need even edgier and even more religious weirdos.__

    ---

    Church of the Six Deities at your service. We tell you what the big guys upstairs are saying - sounds pretty fishy right? But hey, they're actually here to back us up!

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Church of the Six Deities](Church%20of%20the%20Six%20Deities.md)

-   __Can we just have a normal civilization without gimmicks?__

    ---

    Presenting the laziest of the political entity lot: the Criodun! With a weird ass name and a weirder lack of specialty, these guys are sure to not be of any interest.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Criodun](Criodun.md)

-   __Is there really no clich√© prophecy trope here?__

    ---

    Yes. Yes, there is. The Cult of the Aethein represents a bunch of idiots being lazy and waiting for someone to save the world for them, plus my obsession with wings.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Cult of the Aethein](Cult%20of%20the%20Aethein.md)

-   __I'm a nerd and want to connect with other nerds.__

    ---

    I mean, you could ask me. Ignoring that, you can ask - the Daethai! Research incorporated, except this time it's a whole country. Yeah, I know that's the second one.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Daethai](Daethai.md)

-   __Are there really six immortals? Not four, or five?__

    ---

    I hate math. Math sucks. It just gets under my skin, but subtraction really is interesting right? Quite mystifying, I would say! Who knew that six minus one equals five?

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Dominion of Chaos](Dominion%20of%20Chaos.md)

-   __I'm an edgelord and want to see DEATH and DESTRUCTION__

    ---

    Well you've come at an opportune time! There's a rain of death and destruction being dropped around the cosmos by our favourite spooky shadow demons: the Dysphorium!

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Dysphorium](Dysphorium.md)

-   __Seven foot rats, rats along his rats. When he sees your rats it all fades to rats.__

    ---

    Correct password! The Haelborne might have some other traits going for em - 'fixing' the cosmos, being born with the power of a nuclear bomb... but most importantly, RAT.

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Haelborne](Haelborne.md)

-   __I hate mice! They're so disgusting and weird!__

    ---

    The Haelborne think so too! So they'd love for you to join their ongoing genocide against the Heathborne. Interdimensional space rats against interdimensional space mice!

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Heathborne](Heathborne.md)

-   __This story is too serious for me. I want some jokes.__

    ---

    idi0cy.inc has a lot of jokes. In fact, I think they're a joke. A gag, canonized and inserted into the fabric of the main narrative! How devious! Is such idiocy legal?!

    [:octicons-arrow-right-24: idi0cy.inc](idi0cy.inc.md)

-   __I want violence and war. Glory to the empire! Manifest destiny!__

    ---

    The local space orc faction is exactly what you're looking for. The Verion are hellbent on scouring the cosmos and enlightening every reality in existence!
