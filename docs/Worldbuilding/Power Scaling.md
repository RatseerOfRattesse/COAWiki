# Power Scaling

## Basic Guide to Terms
Contextualized with HWFWM and other random things I like. I understand that doesn't make this especially accessible, but it makes sense to me :P

Basic guide to terms used:

- Iron rank: slightly above regular mortal power. Imagine peak iron rank as the highest a mortal could achieve regularly simply through training and dedication

- Bronze rank: superhumans. Lifting cars is the average.

- Silver rank: now we're talking. Demolishing villages, killing tyrannosaur swarms.

- Gold rank: incredible power. Beating Godzilla

- Low-mid diamond rank: levelling small cities, supersonic travel.

- High diamond rank: blowing up Liechtenstein, owning planets.

- Peak diamond rank: near godlike. Dawn blew up a Builder metropolis and scorched the surrounding US state-sized desert so hard it turned into glass.

- Astral Being: leaving the mortal form entirely, become an astral being. Y'know the Sanguine Horror, which in physical forms can scour an entire world of life? Yeah, that's what we're talking.

- Great Astral Being: You've lost the ability to think in individuals. You don't see Barry walking down the street, you see his bank account's future debt up to his death, into his descendants' suffering, and his exact impact on the global economy. You could probably remake entire universes if you wanted to.

- Folly: it doesn't matter how powerful this person is. They can write the fucking story, what are you gonna do?
