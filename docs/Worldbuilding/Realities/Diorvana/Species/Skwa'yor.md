The Skwa’yor have a humanoid torso, with two extra arms sticking out of where the shoulder blades would be. Instead of a pair of legs, they have what looks like the bottom of a ribcage sticking out from their flesh. Two rib-like bone structures support a central fleshy “spine” with another hand on it. Each hand has three strong claws, capable of piercing stone. Their heads are also somewhat human-shaped, though they have no visible mouth, sounds emanating from underneath layers of skin. They have no nose and a single large eye in the centre of their faces, a dark void in which a simple circle floats about as a pupil. Antlers sprout from the tops of their bald heads. Their brains are inside their “torsos” as the eye and vocal cords take up most of the space in the head.
