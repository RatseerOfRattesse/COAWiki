Diorvana is a world of bleak grey ruin, once home to the skwaâ€™yor, the local intelligent species.

It used to be a lively land but plunged in darkness. The local ecology evolved with almost no light, as Diorvana is a reality that contains only this single flat plane, with minimal light sources and no star. Gravity is so low it barely exists at all- matter is kept in check by the flat, black roof extending over the plane.
