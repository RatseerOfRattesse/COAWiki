Diorvana is a world of bleak grey ruin, once home to the skwaâ€™yor, the local intelligent species.

It used to be a lively land but plunged in darkness. The local ecology evolved with almost no light, as Diorvana is a reality that contains only this single flat plane, with minimal light sources and no star. Gravity is so low it barely exists at all- matter is kept in check by the flat, black roof extending over the plane.

    Some weird guy used 'resurrect dead.' The Plot used 'trope: resurrection is bad'. It was super effective!

    They're dead. There's probably an article on the afterlife here somewhere. But I guess you can read about the boring past...

    Unfortunately, I can't let you dox people in another reality... if they're not plot relevant, of course.

    ---

    Oh, it's all about souls. Cool shit, really. Bit overpowered, but it's bloody metal and just as edgy as everything else.

    A member of a species that I'm sure will be mispronounced for all eternity. Six armed guys with screens for eyes.
