Fae culture is mostly devoid of [Immortal](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Metaphysical%20Beings.md) influence, due to how Kaaldenvale is shielded from the rest of the cosmos. This also meant a lack of intelligence about various other things, such as [firmament theory](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/index.md). To remedy this, [the Chaos](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Metaphysical%20Beings.md#the-primal-chaos) allowed a small amount of permeability in the [dimensional](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/index.md#reality-composition) barrier that allowed faevinity to see small snatches of what lies beyond yet didn’t allow passage from either side without a large concentrated effort.

The fae have a decent grasp of firmament theory, knowing the basics of the parts of a reality. Recent papers have noted a significant, rather unscientific, ‘vibe’ of artificiality, which has been cause for minor concern, but only in the scientific community. Vibes do actually play a larger role in aura science due to the existence of metaphysics and the interactions between soul and aura. It’s rather hard to define whether you’re feeling important scientific values or you’re schizophrenic, but being able to get an actual ‘vibe’ at all from anything is unusual.

Fae have preliminary theories about [the Void](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/index.md#voidspace) and means of [dimensional transgression](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/index.md#dimensional-transgression), but have been unable to test them. However, with lack of firmamental subjects to study, the focus that would have gone there is on [aura mechanics](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Aura%20Mechanics.md). Fae aura tech is incredibly advanced for their stage (which is around 1960s in Earth terms), with some of the most efficient systems you’ll find on worlds at their technology level. They’ve also got no detriment of what would be considered ‘modern technology’ on Earth, with instant long-distance communication being a slowly emerging phenomenon. Their prowess comes from combining these two not-really dualities, allowing their technology to be much more powerful than either by itself.
