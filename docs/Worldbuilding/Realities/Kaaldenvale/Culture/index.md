-   __Who do these idiots worship?__

    ---

    The trinity of emotions! Pleasure, pain, and fear. More on that here. And about the whole six hells thing too I guess.

-   __Do the fae get paid holidays?__

    ---

    Maybe. Exploitative working conditions are everywhere. There is one that's mandated though. Suspiciously cult like too.

-   __Do the fae speak Sindarin?__

    ---

    No. Their linguistic systems are a lot more simple because they weren't made by a linguist. Also, I never actually read LOTR.

-   __How advanced is this civilization?__

    ---

    They have magic, bullshit, and also invented duct tape. So, about our level I'd say - just with significantly less bullshit.

-   __THIS ISN'T IMMERSIVE ENOUGH!!!!!!!__

    ---

    Of course it is! Look, I even made a list of measurements the fae use. Don't mind that it's just a reskin of the metric system.
