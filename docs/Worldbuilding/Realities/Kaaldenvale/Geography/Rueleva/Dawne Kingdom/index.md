The Dawne Kingdom is much like the Autumn Kingdom but prefers to lock up its borders and keep its prosperous haven inside its walls. It spontaneously sprang up some three hundred years ago, under the rule of a woman so high-ranked she was practically Immortal (cough, Raelia Hastor, cough). Capital city is Aethereanil.

    Aethereanil! Where the palaces of the wealthy quite literally float over the ruins of the people they killed.

    Dawne doesn't really need other cities because Aethereanil spans the country. There are a few mountains in the way though.
