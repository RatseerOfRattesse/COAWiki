    In good old Eorwin, the noob continent with generically temperate environs and classically inept governments.

    ---

    Welcome to Rueleva, the *pro* continent with generically frozen environs and ept governments! They are more evil though.

    ---

    It turns out we do. Don't know why I made this other than to have an underwater area. It's just an Atlantis ripoff.

    ---

    NOPE. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. I WOULD NEVER COME UP WITH SUCH A GENERIC NAME AND CONCEPT.

    I mean, you could just read the wiki... or, you could visit the Delirans! It really sounds like they're on drugs, but they're not.

    ---

    Allevfel Island, my friend. One side has prehistoric fae. The other has a bunch of unruly adventurers. Same level of civility.

    The Shwombosians have a weird ass name and *had* a civilization. Turns out telling the future invites some *things* after your head.
