The Sehrogate Republic is a small, isolated nation seeking a larger territory- and failing at every step. Now, the Republic is inhabited by small numbers of high-ranked retired adventurers, remaining mostly quiet in terms of activity, though rumours are brewing of a return to their previous colonization habits. Capital city is Alluvlos.
