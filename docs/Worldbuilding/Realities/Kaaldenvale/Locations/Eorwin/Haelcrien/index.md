Haelcrien is divided into three provinces- Haequar, which includes Javenshard. It's mainly covered in peaceful, monster-free plains, filled with farmland. Beyond that are small pockets of taiga surrounding small, isolated mountain ranges. Then thereâ€™s Dewlos, mountainous and cold, and Samemmemnon (the capital, Avertine, is here)- pretty similar to Haequar. Their currency is haelcoin.
