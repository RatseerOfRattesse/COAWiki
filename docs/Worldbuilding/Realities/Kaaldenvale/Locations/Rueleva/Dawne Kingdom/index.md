The Dawne Kingdom is much like the Autumn Kingdom but prefers to lock up its borders and keep its prosperous haven inside its walls. It spontaneously sprang up some three hundred years ago, under the rule of a woman so high-ranked she was practically Immortal (cough, Raelia Hastor, cough). Capital city is Aethereanil.
