Dustheus is a land consisting mainly of snowy mountains and tundra, with sparse but advanced population centres. It was once the foundation of a far larger civilization known as the Miruen Empire, which was mysteriously destroyed some three hundred years ago (VIOLENT COUGH, Raelia Hastor, VIOLENT COUGH) and is stilled littered with Miruenâ€™s ruins. The lack of historical records on this period is concerning, yet nobody cares (um, idk, EARTH-SHAKING COUGH, Raelia Hastor, EARTH-SHAKING COUGH). Capital city is Prieniad.
