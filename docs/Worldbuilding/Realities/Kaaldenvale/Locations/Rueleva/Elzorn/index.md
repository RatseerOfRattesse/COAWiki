Elzornâ€™s climate and landscape is much like Dustheus but includes more and more winding canyons and spires the further south you go. Also like Dustheus, it was part of the Miruen Empire, is covered in ruins, and is sparsely populated, except for the two islands also part of its domain. Elzorn has two capitals, each one mostly covering one of the two islands, which are both named after its resident city: Lilianaera and Arkenturia.
