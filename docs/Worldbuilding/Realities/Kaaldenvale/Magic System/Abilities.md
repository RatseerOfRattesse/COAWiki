Abilities can be attained through manifestations similar to the far rarer concept manifestations. They are actually quite common and appear in a similar way to concept manifestations, except in far less extreme circumstances.

Abilities will also be gained randomly during particularly stressful and important situations. These abilities tend to be more connected or representative of the user and will help the user with their situation – though there will always be an element dependent on the user.

Abilities manifestations are distilled on gaining, being funnelled through the filter of a specialization to end up with a random ability. Abilities are rarely unique- that is to say, it’s definitely possible for two people to get the same ability.

One can still gain abilities without a specialization, but such abilities will not synergize together and will form sporadically according to the situation you gain them in.
