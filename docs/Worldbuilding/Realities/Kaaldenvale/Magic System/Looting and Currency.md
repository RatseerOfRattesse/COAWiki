# Looting and Currency
*this is a stable economic system, trust me*

    Article contains spoilers: Full Series

Tapping a dead being will prompt the Governance to ask if you want to loot it. When looting a creature, the Governance will absorb it, [metaphysical and physical](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Metasphere.md) (except for the [soul](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Souls.md), if applicable), and refine that energy into items. This will generally produce a custom form of metaphysical energy called currency energy. The Governance clients of a being will absorb this energy within the being, who can choose to withdraw it at any time.

The amount of currency energy a person can hold is dependent on their tier, specifically, the robustness of their physical body. Too much currency energy will overload a weak body and harm it. To remedy this, people can siphon this energy away into specialized containers.

Currency energy is actually just a refinement of various metaphysical energies, engineered for safe use by the Governance.

The people of Kaaldenvale measure currency energy in coins and this value is consistent everywhere. Its convenience makes it the most common form of currency used in Kaaldenvale.
