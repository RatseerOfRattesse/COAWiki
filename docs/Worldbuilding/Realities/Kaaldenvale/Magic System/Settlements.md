Settlements each have a level, dictating what sort of technology they can use- similar to a civ-building strategy game. At each level, more upgrades to the settlement become available, at the cost of experience points stored up in the settlement. However, these points are gathered alongside the main points used to level up the settlement, being obtained in the same way. Think of it as a settlement generating double experience, but one half is used to level and the other used to upgrade.
