A specialization is somewhat analogous to the RPG concept of “Class.” The key difference is that instead of being based upon a profession, these specializations are based on a base concept. For example, a specialization concept of “feast,” could mean a literal feast- the result being a cook of some sort- or a feast of some other thing, such as life force, resulting in some manner of life-leeching combat specialization.

Specializations are formed within an individual by absorbing manifestations, various objects containing concentrated ‘concept.’ Manifestations form naturally in places where there has been an overflow of some concept. Manifestations are more powerful depending on how large an overflow is. For example, the concept “Internecion” could occur during a war of nuclear proportions. “Fire” could occur in a burnt down house, while “Inferno” could appear down in the deepest depths of a volcano. Manifestations often produce more powerful abilities when used by the one who found them. The Governance allows variation such as this because it recognized the benefits of versatility. Making all fae the same would be detrimental to their future performance.

Without a specialization, a user may still level and use other aspects of the Governance. However, their abilities and other aspects will not lean towards a theme/synergize with each other, leading to an overall less efficient power set.
