Titles are passive abilities that are exceedingly rare. They are ingrained upon birth and can only be unlocked in very specific circumstances. They are bestowed by the [Chaos](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Metaphysical%20Beings.md#the-primal-chaos) itself (and other higher authorities) on those it wishes to have them.
