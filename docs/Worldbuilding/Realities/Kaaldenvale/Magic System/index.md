The RPG-ish magic system of Kaaldenvale was introduced millennia ago when a godlike being (Primal Chaos) intruded on Kaaldenvale. Before the Chaos took its role as Raelia Hastor, it decided to play god for a little while, dealing with the mortals of Kaaldenvale that would’ve been taboo had it still been among the Six.  It strengthened Kaaldenvale and hid it from the gaze of the experiments on Kaaldenvale during this period, replicating elements seen in other realities and refining them to its purposes, namely the magic system, which the Chaos chose over any number of other variations for its order and strictures, something that, contrary to what you might think, fascinated more than repelled it. The existence of something so at odds with nature yet seemingly a fundamental part of reality has inspired conspiracy theorists that believe the world is a simulation.

The purpose of the Governance is to aid the locals against any incoming dimensional forces, giving them a fighting chance against any invading Immortal authority.
The Governance is rooted at a sentient core built over a deposit of reality fabric

Despite the intent of making the Governance artificial, orderly, and perfect, the Chaos could not go against its nature. Below the shiny screens and complex mechanics, the Governance’s sentience allows it to make conscious decisions to aid or deter characters.

The magic system is referred to by the denizens of Kaaldenvale by various names, the most common being simply, “the Governance.”Other names for the Governance include “the Script,” “the System.”

The Governance is one of the few experiments of the Chaos that it decided to keep in open reach of mortals, being one of the few that the mortals would be somewhat responsible with.

The Governance is not unique- there are plenty of other worlds with similar systems.
