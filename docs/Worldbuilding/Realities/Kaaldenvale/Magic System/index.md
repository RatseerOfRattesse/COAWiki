## Introduction
The magic system of [Kaaldenvale]() was introduced millennia ago when a godlike being ([Primal Chaos](../../../The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/Metaphysical%20Beings.md#the-primal-chaos)) intruded on Kaaldenvale. Before the Chaos took its role as [Raelia Hastor](../../../../Characters/Mainline%20Characters/Raelia%20Hastor.md), it decided to play god for a little while, dealing with the mortals of Kaaldenvale in ways that would’ve been taboo had it still been among the Six.  It strengthened Kaaldenvale and hid it from the gaze of the experiments on Kaaldenvale during this period, replicating elements seen in other realities and refining them to its purposes, namely the magic system, which the Chaos chose over any number of other variations for its order and strictures, something that, contrary to what you might think, fascinated more than repelled it.

The magic system manifests as the Governance. It bestows itself upon all native inhabitants of Kaaldenvale, and can be accessed by them in the form of floating translucent screens. This is the front of the Governance, using numbers and statistics to organize the intensely chaotic churn of magic within its users. The existence of something so at odds with nature yet seemingly a fundamental part of reality has inspired conspiracy theorists that believe the world is a simulation.

The fundamental purpose of the Governance is to aid the locals against any incoming dimensional forces, giving them a fighting chance against anything that would bother coming after the hiding Chaos.

The Governance is rooted at a sentient core built on an island in [Aunper](../Geography/Aunper/index.md). Despite the intent of making the Governance artificial, orderly, and perfect, the Chaos could not go against its nature. Below the shiny screens and complex mechanics, the Governance’s sentience allows it to make conscious decisions to aid or deter characters.

The magic system is referred to by the denizens of Kaaldenvale by various names, the most common being simply, “the Governance.” Other names for the Governance include “the Script,” “the System,” and other similarly generic LitRPG system names.
