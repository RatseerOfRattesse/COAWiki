Kaaldenvale is populated by the fae. Their ears resemble unevenly serrated blades. They have grayish skin tones with red blood. Their bloodlines each have a signature colour that mixes into their eyes and hair along with what humans would consider ‘natural’ colours.

They evolved from predatory mammals, and thus have many weapons integrated in their bodies, including retractable claws and serrated flexible ears (which used to be entire limbs, but have since shrunken down to a mere display of status).

Fae come of age at eighteen. Their physical features include pointed ears with varied lengths, abnormally colourful eyes and bony ridges along their backs. They’re six foot at average by adulthood.

Fae believe themselves the children of divinity, hence the fae equivalent of ‘humanity’ being ‘faevinity’. They never changed it after these older religions died out.

The Immortals were recent discoveries for the Fae. They had observed divine activity in Kaaldenvale and in large magic effects vaguely sensible when you’ve pressed yourself right up against the dimensional barrier.

The Fae have been able to breach Kaaldenvale’s atmosphere and reach their equivalent of space – of course, this only stretches for a few kilometres before reaching the dimensional barrier where the stars sat.
