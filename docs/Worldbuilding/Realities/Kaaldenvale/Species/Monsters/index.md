Monsters, along with the Governance, were created by the Primal Chaos to secure Kaaldenvale. Needing a source of energy for users of the Governance to utilize, the Chaos created hidden chambers known as dungeons throughout the world. These dungeons are largely undiscovered and spew out a regular wave of monsters every month. Discovered dungeons are often exploited and kept secret by those who find them. Because of this, dungeons aren’t public knowledge, and most public parties who know about them are very wrong about the details and marked as conspiracy theorists.

Monsters are completely separated from natural ecosystems. The Governance was designed to help defend Kaaldenvale and will only interact with the most powerful race currently on planet.

Monsters are controlled by the Governance – think of them like a hive mind, of which the Hub is the master. Intelligent monsters are like generals in an army.
The Chaos decided not to simply leave vessels of magic lying around for the fae to pick up. This would be dangerous, as the raw magic would be very volatile. Creating monsters also gave it the opportunity to let the fae train themselves in combat.

Due to the need for the Chaos to hide itself, it preferred using the locals to carry out its experiments. This included dungeons. The Chaos made a deal with the Delirans; it would provide them with a bit of ancient knowledge, and they would help it construct the dungeons and their mechanisms. For this reason, some ancient Deliran signage can be found in dungeons.
