Snakes with spike-ridged backs and a particularly large spike attached to the end of their tails. Their teeth contain powerful venom, but they seldom use it. Because of this, they are often hunted for their teeth. Can be found in the northern forests of Haelcrien and the southern plains of the Autumn Kingdom.
