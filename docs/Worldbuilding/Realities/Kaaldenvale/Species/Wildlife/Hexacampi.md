Armoured four foot tall crustaceans. They have a central circular carapace which includes all their organs and act as both torso and head. Eyes surround the sides of the carapace. They have six armoured legs, and their armour is covered in spiky ridges. Hexacampi begin their life cycle as a larvae in the ocean and grow to an adult form that can transit through both water and land. The fae domesticated them several centuries ago as a mount.
