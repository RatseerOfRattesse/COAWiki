-   __Why is this universe 100% insignificant and irrelevant?__

-   __Why is it six or twelve hells?__

    ---

    Because six and twelve are really cool numbers. Otherwise, no idea! But you can read about where hell is here. It's spooky.

-   __I'm a Dewlos simp and need to find Dewlos.__

    ---

    Of course you are. Everyone is a Dewlos simp. Dewlos is the best province. It's better than Haequar. And Sammemmemnon.

-   __Is this LitRPG system interesting at all?__

    ---

    Very! I mean, it's mildly well balanced... but hey, it might also have been planted there by a god or something. Who knows???

    ---
