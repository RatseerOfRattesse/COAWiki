## Introduction
Communication in reality-spanning empires is a difficult endeavour, but necessary for large scale civilizations to operate. To remedy these issues, interdimensional societies have developed various ways to contact each other.

## Circumventing Light Lag
Light speed may not be an issue in [the Void](Firmament%20Theory/index.md#voidspace), but it certainly is within the bounds of some realities. One does have to remember, however, that the laws of physics are not all the same everywhere. Some realities simply never have to deal with it.

Those who did have found it far easier to simply sidestep the issue rather than going at it head on. Though there are various methods to break past the speed of light, it’s more common to route communication through metaphysical constructs. Building infrastructure in the metasphere in locations coterminous to intended physical destinations. Data is encoded into aura streams and sent along its way.

## Interworld Communications
These systems function much the same way as those used to circumvent lightspeed. Aura streams containing data floating through the Void. However, due to the need to cross realities, these streams cannot flow relatively freely as they can in the firmament’s reality nodes and instead have to follow the firmament lattice.

In the same way that dimensional vessels require time to travel through the Void, so does data - not due to some inherent limit but due to the need to preserve the integrity of the payload. This also affects lightspeed circumvention networks, but is barely noticeable, much like how light is fast enough that we don’t see a delay in everyday life.
