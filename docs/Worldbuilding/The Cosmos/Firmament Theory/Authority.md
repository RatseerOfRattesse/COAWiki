## Narrative Stack
The concept of a narrative stack is that each world is a fictional narrative in a higher world in the narrative stack, and creates more worlds lower down in the narrative stack in the forms of fiction.

## Authority
Authority is my excuse for canonizing the whole plot hole and random bullshittery part of the story. It’s given out by the Narrator (me :D). There's no transfer process in canon or anything.

Basically authority is the ability to affect the narrative. Think of it like me being Mouthpiece and dishing out little bits of lesser divinity to friends, except instead of ban tech, it’s just the ability to write.

I have the ultimate Authority, being the Narrator. idi0cy.inc also has a bunch of Authority, as he canonically exists inside COA and is my ideas man. So do my other friends.

Another level of Authority would theoretically be the fandom if it ever gains one. They have a sort of lesser Authority, only being able to expand on the story or create alternate versions of it.

Now, how is this relevant to the story? Obviously, I want to have it explained by idiocy.inc or whatever, but I also want Ari to be able to obtain some, along with all the reality bending shit she does. The thing is, that's impossible. Ari physically cannot have Authority, because she's inside of the story. I'd have to somehow make her exist here on Earth. So, there are two ways to incorporate this.

A) Lesser Authority. The ability to affect another lower narrative stack.

B) Some kind of representation of her here. Maybe an AI bot, or having somebody sub in. Maybe she could make a deal with the Narrator or some other distributor of Authority. A condition of that deal would somehow make something that isn't her here in this narrative plane be her and make sense canonically.

C) COA is actually two narrative layers down. The layer directly below this one is a mirror, and is inhabited by the Narrator as a character. In that layer, I can screw around with reality all I want.

## The Narrator

In COA, I am the Narrator. Arbiter of all things in that world. In universe, the Narrator is not akin to a deity - they are immortal and invincible, but cannot comprehend things like and Elder Immortal can. However, they do control absolutely everything in that world.
