## Time Streams

There exists a third level of matter below the [metasphere](Metasphere.md). This is the running undercurrent of all things: the chronosphere, realm of time. To allow you comprehension of this realm, I’ll use a physical model.

The chronosphere can be imagined as an empty void with pillars floating within it. Each pillar represents the time stream of one reality and consists of millions of nodes. Each node represents an element of that reality’s history.

These columns continue growing upwards infinitely and it takes immense power to staunch this process. Because of this, if you remove enough nodes in there to have parts of the column tilt, the column will continue growing upwards creating a branched time stream.

This is extremely dangerous to both branches. Because nodes are mutually attracted to each other, a branch’s nodes will attract back to the main trunk over and over, merging and messing up both timelines. This only stops when enough nodes grow along the branch for its attraction to hold it together. Even then, the resulting time stream will be corrupted due to misplacement of the foundational nodes.

If a branch grows diagonally far enough, attractive force and proximity may allow it merge with other reality’s timelines. Due to the difference in fundamental laws between some realities, this can cause damage of even greater magnitude than a regular branching issue. Eventually the affected streams will self correct, but will still be scarred. This is why things like relativity exist.
