A Domain is matter that has been claimed by a being. This being gains full power over that [physical matter](Metasphere.md), the only limit being how much of that power they can exert without overloading their bodies and destroying themselves. Matter sanctified becomes entirely subject to the claimant, who may move, reshape, and transmute the matter into anything they so wish. Sanctified matter can only include physical matter, but in the rare cases of matter attuned to a soul or another inviolable object, that matter cannot be sanctified without first acquiring the consent of that object.

Domains can only be created through various esoteric methods.
