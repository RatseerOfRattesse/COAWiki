A Domain is matter that has been claimed by a being. This being gains full power over that physical matter, the only limit being how much of that power they can exert without overloading their souls and destroying themselves. Matter sanctified becomes entirely subject to the claimant, who may move, reshape, and transmute the matter into anything they so wish. Sanctified matter cannot include souls and other inviolable objects.

Domains can only be created through various esoteric methods.
