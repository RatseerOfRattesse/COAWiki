# Living Cosmos
*entertainment for the masses*

## Engine of Change

[Mortal souls](Souls.md) are the fuel of the cosmos, and each intelligent soul is born with a desire to survive, and if that is met, thrive. They all carry an inextinguishable ambition. Their nature makes things change, pushes things outside of their regular patterns. This keeps the cosmos interesting and therefore worthwhile for the Narrator to continue keeping alive. [Immortal souls](Metaphysical%20Beings.md) are dedicated to continuing the cycle of the cosmos. They want everything to stay pristine.

Because of their nature, both types of souls are bound to come into conflict, and therefore provide interest to the cosmos. Without the idea of this world's existence on the higher narrative plane, this world ceases to exist. Human memories and ideas count, so does digital storage such as this. If all of it is eviscerated, then the cosmos will unexist on the spot.

## Consciousness and Hardship

We have often wondered over the nature of consciousness for millennia, and in recent times have concluded that it is incredibly inefficient. A programmed yet intelligently capable creature, with no opinions, no awareness of self, is far more efficient than, say, a human. Why did consciousness evolve if it’s so inefficient?

The answer lies not in the [physisphere](Metasphere.md), but the metasphere. Conscious beings are so inefficient as to detriment the physisphere, but that is simply a trade off for essential payoff in the metasphere. You see, souls are the only source of consciousness. A regular non-conscious animal has no soul, and is just another form of physical entropy. Through those sickly webs of proteins and nerves and whatever the heck confusing biology, they’re predictable like all other physical processes.

A soul is the core of consciousness: the ability to be and create randomness, unpredictability. Change. The narrative engine relies on change to keep the [narrative](Authority.md) afloat, and consciousness is its main producer. And to force souls to produce change, the cosmos forces hardship on all conscious beings. Forces them to create more, to progress in need of survival, until they reach newer heights and can make bigger changes. The cosmos is inherently chaotic for survival, needs more magnitude and change for it.

Or, as I originally put it in my notes:

HARDSHIP IS A ROOT OF THE LIVING COSMOS

ACROSS ALL REALITIES, SENTIENTS SUFFER BECAUSE IT DRIVES CHANGE, ACTION FOR THE NARRATIVE

EVOLUTION IS A DERIVATIVE OF THIS, CREATING SENTIENTS TO SUFFER AND MAKE CHANGE

LIFE WITHOUT SENTIENCE IS JUST MORE ENTROPY AND ALL ENTROPY CAN DO IS BE PREDICTABLE, DO THE SAME THINGS OVER AND OVER NO MATTER THE TIMESPAN

FREE WILL EXISTS ONLY IN THE METAPHYSICAL, IN SOULS WHICH CAN ONLY LIVE IN SENTIENCE

sentience is worth its cost because only souls can have sentience and souls are metaphysical - the payoff is not of the physiphere but the metasphere ! ! !

souls can take conscious action, and make change for the narrative
