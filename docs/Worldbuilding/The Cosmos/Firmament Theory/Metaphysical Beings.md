Minor immortals are ruled by five Great Immortals. They are: the Mist Lord, the Eternal Light, the Saviour, the Reaper, and the Primordial Equilibrium. These deities are known to all interdimensional civilizations, who worship them. Some fringe civilizations worship other deities that supposedly came before, and these peoples are considered blasphemous.

## The Elder Immortals

When the cosmos was reborn after the Precursors killed themselves, seven Immortals were created from the Precursor’s experiments: Time, Equilibrium, Chaos, Authority, Energy, Creation, and Destruction. They each governed their aspect of the cosmos.

## The Usurpers

The Elder Immortals were usurped by six mortals risen to transcendency through strip-mining the fabric of worlds. These mortals' names were all lost, and they gave themselves new ones: Mist Lord, Eternal Light, Saviour, Reaper, Primordial Equilibrium, and Primal Chaos. They brainwashed the cosmos (mostly uninhabited at the time) into believing that they were the original Great Immortals, and nothing had come before.

When the Elder Immortals were vanquished, they didn’t completely disappear. Think of it being like Ouranos being chopped up by the Titans. They all left fragments, artifacts that channeled what power they had left - such as the Firmament Glass. These fragments can take mortal hosts and bond to them, sharing their power.

What the Great Immortals became was not truly equal to the Elder Immortals. They simply accumulated enough power to kill off the Elders, then take parts of them to channel higher energy and act like the Elders. These parts acted as mediums to channel higher energies so that the Great Immortals’ still mortal minds didn’t have to.

From then on, they continued strip-mining worlds under the guise of "Revaluation" of the opposing forces to keep them balanced. However, the Primal Chaos, existing outside of the balance of the other five by nature, was not enthused by this new plot- balance was its antithesis and the other five Immortals continued working to restore it.

The Chaos descended from transcendency under the guise of its old identity, the woman Raelia Hastor, arriving in the reality of Kaaldenvale. She passed down through the Hastor dynasty the Firmament Glass, a transcendent artifact containing a fragment of Time's consciousness, which would aid her family in the quest to overthrow the new Immortals. Thousands of years later, the Advent of the Haelborne begins, with eighteen-year-old Aryon Hastor in possession of the Glass and therefore the fate of the cosmos.

## Transcendence

Physical beings can become metaphysical beings through transcendence. This requires long and arduous accumulation of power and understanding until one reaches a state of equilibrium. This state is consciousness — the ability to create and defy entropy, but with none of the drawbacks — no self doubt, no stupidity, none of the counterproductive parts of consciousness, just stripped down free will.

Most beings fail transcendence. They can’t reach this state not because of the power requirement but because of the need to become efficient whilst conscious.

This also brings up the question of how some metaphysical beings aren’t actually efficient consciousnesses, such as the Great Immortals. This is because they are only partially transcendent. They have the power and the mechanical things that make metaphysicals metaphysical, but fail to be as efficient as a true transcendent.

An even greater factor is that at this time most of the cosmos is disillusioned into thinking that efficient consciousness is not part of transcendence because the Great Immortals don’t have it. Such an idea had never crossed their minds.
