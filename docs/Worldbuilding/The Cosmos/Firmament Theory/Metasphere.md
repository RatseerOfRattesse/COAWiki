The cosmos consists of two main schools of matter. There are various subclasses and outliers, but those would take entire books to cover and are such a minority that even an established world-hopping civilization would be unlikely to encounter them in their lifetimes. These two schools are the physical and metaphysical.

Physical matter is the topmost layer of a reality from all perspectives. Physical matter is the outer layer of reality– it encapsulates and provides a form for reality. This is your tables and chairs, planets and stars, animals and plants. The stuffing is the metaphysical matter – souls, ambient aura, gods and spirits.

Both can exist separately but have a symbiotic relationship. Metaphysical matter takes hold of physical vessels in order to influence physical reality. Physical matter is dependent on metaphysical forces to fuel life.

Physical matter cannot exist in a metaphysical space, but metaphysical matter can exist coterminous to a location in a physical space – a reality. If physical matter is introduced to a metaphysical space, it will simply unexist, whilst metaphysical matter in a reality will drift out if not anchored.
