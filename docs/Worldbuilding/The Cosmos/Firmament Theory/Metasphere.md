## Matter Classes
The cosmos consists of two main schools of matter. There are various subclasses and outliers, but those would take entire books to cover and are such a minority that even an established world-hopping civilization would be unlikely to encounter them in their lifetimes. These two schools are the physical and metaphysical.

Physical matter is the topmost layer of a reality from all perspectives. Physical matter is the outer layer of reality– it encapsulates and provides a form for reality. This is your tables and chairs, planets and stars, animals and plants. The stuffing is the metaphysical matter – [souls](Souls.md), [aura](Aura%20Mechanics.md), [gods and spirits](Metaphysical%20Beings.md).

Both can exist separately but have a symbiotic relationship. Metaphysical matter takes hold of physical vessels in order to influence physical reality. Physical matter is dependent on metaphysical forces to fuel life.

Physical matter cannot exist in a metaphysical space, but metaphysical matter can exist coterminous to a location in a physical space – a reality. If physical matter is introduced to a metaphysical space, it will simply unexist, whilst metaphysical matter in a reality will drift out if not anchored.

## Metasphere and Physisphere

Metaphysical matter exists coterminous to physical matter — another dimension, if you will. The realm in which this matter exists is called the metasphere, and it’s like the under structure of the physisphere, the realm of physical matter.

The metasphere, on a cosmic scale, can be thought of as a pond of lily pads, wherein the water represents the metasphere and the lilies the physisphere. This is because the physisphere is only existent in realities and other physical spaces, and [the Void](../Firmament%20Theory/index.md), as a metaphysical space, extends over far more area than physical space.
On a reality scale, the metasphere is everywhere the physisphere is. This and the [firmament](../Firmament%20Theory/index.md) are separate things. The metasphere encapsulates the firmament - it exists in metaphysical space. The metasphere however, also contains every other metaphysical thing.

Things in the metasphere can exist and move, and a location in the metasphere has an equivalent in the physisphere. The most prominent example of this is the soul. It will move around in the metasphere according to the position of it’s host. All other metaphysical objects attuned to physical objects do this.

Aura and such also exists in the metasphere, and so do metaphysical beings. Their presence in areas of the metasphere coterminous to areas in the physisphere can have effects on those areas in physical space.
