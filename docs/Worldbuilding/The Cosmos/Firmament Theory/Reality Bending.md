## Introduction
Reality bending is a way of channeling [metaphysical energy](Metasphere.md) that takes a form of metaphysical energy right out of the [soul](Souls.md) and uses it to reshape reality. This requires certain properties for the soul in question, including the ability to break a body’s naturally imposed energy limit.

The channels required to use this energy are usually only usable by [metaphysical entities](Metaphysical%20Beings.md), who don’t have to worry about a fragile body to channel through. Physical entities attempting reality bending run the risk of destroying their bodies if using too much power. Therefore, this is extremely strenuous for them and can cause massive spiritual backlash after the fact.
