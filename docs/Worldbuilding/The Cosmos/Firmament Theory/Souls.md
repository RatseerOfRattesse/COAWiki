Souls are created in castes. Mortal souls are incarnated into mortal bodies and given a single chance at life. Their purpose is to be fuel for the cosmos.

Immortal souls never enter life and are a heck of a lot rarer. They preside outside of reality, in the unfathomable void between worlds. Their purpose is to be the cosmos’ immune system, perusing realities to cleanse any hinderances to the process, such as mortals gaining a widespread method of becoming immortal.

The cosmos, like a living lifeform, produces more minor immortals, all under the command of the Great Immortals.

Modification of the soul is going to be a big element of the series. Let’s start with what a soul is and what it isn’t. A soul cannot think. That’s a function of the body, requiring a brain or an equivalent organ.

The soul is a vessel of immense power- at least to our perspective. The magic stored inside a single soul could flatten worlds if unleashed, yet to the cosmos it’s as insignificant as a single sac of ATP.
