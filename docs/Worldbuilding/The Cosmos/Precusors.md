Before the current cosmos was another, born when this narrative plane was formed. It was much like the current version, scattered worlds over the Void, inhabited by various lifeforms. However, there was one significant difference. There were no [Immortals](Firmament%20Theory/Metaphysical%20Beings.md).

Without the boundaries set by such beings, civilizations were free to thrive as they pleased. One civilization took this to the extreme. Today, they are only known as the Precursors, for their names were lost to time and catastrophe. They developed technology and conquered territory that eclipsed anything that modern day groups could accomplish. They mastered the rules of physics and metaphysics, stopped time, shattered photons, travelled in 20D and brutally outclassed the speed of light. Finally, they had only only only one frontier left: the incomprehensible. The ideas behind things like the vastness and mechanics of [the Void](Firmament%20Theory/index.md/#voidspace). The Precursors wanted to master those things incomprehensible to the mortal mind.

But even for them, this was impossible. The mortal mind simply could not comprehend it, and neither could any medium they dreamt up. Finally, the Precursors came to a consensus. If they couldn’t master the incomprehensible, they had to at least see it with their own eyes.

So they attempted to unleash seven higher ideas into their realm, each one containing the understanding of a fundamental part of the cosmos. The results were catastrophic. Worlds burst and flattened, the Precursors’ network wiped from existence. The lattice of worlds collapsed into the Void in all but a few seedling sections.

But, in the end, they succeeded. Unable to find anything powerful enough to comprehend them, the seven ideas formed themselves into beings: the [Elder Immortals](Firmament%20Theory/Metaphysical%20Beings.md/#the-elder-immortals) of Time, Authority, Energy, Creation, Destruction, Chaos, and Equilibrium.

The Immortals awoke and decided to restore the cosmos, allowing dead seeds to germinate once more.
