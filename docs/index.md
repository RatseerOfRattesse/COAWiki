# Chronicles of the Aethein

*A high fantasy LitRPG book series illustrated and written by RatseerOfRattesse*

**Warning for lots of gore, profanity, and edgy jokes :)**

**If you'd like to yell at me, DM ratseerofrattesse on Discord.**

A fun little passion project starring Aryon Hastor, who wants nothing but to maintain her healthy income monster-hunting job. Unfortunately for her, some interdimensional space rats want to harvest her reality's firmamental fabric! And also, they want her spooky hourglass necklace that may or may not be a family heirloom passed down from an Immortal. Don't worry about that though, 'cuz there's way bigger issues to deal with and this Immortal business definitely won't stab us in the back later. Definitely, nope, never.

While Ari's fucking around on Kaaldenvale, the multiverse is experiencing some wacky problems. The Great Immortals haven't answered any prayers in a century, and the churches are being increasingly offensively dogmatic. Meanwhile, the previously dormant spooky shadow demon population are out on the prowl! They're crawling through your voidways, creeping through your backyards, and scrounging through your organs, and nobody has a fucking clue where they came from. What a century, aye?
