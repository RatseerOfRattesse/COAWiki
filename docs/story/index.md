# Story

Housed here are all the writings I've done associated with COA.

## Conventions

### Categories

Writing here come in three categories:

- :material-book-open: Mainline Story
- These are the main books that will compromise the book series whenever I'm done. Obviously, these are fully canonized. Each book has one prologue and epilogue chapter as well as regular chapters and an index of various LitRPG elements.
- :material-book: Short Stories
- These stories are not locked to the main plot and serve to flesh out other elements of the world or simply random ideas I. Their canonicity is specified per page.
- :material-book-multiple-outline: Writing Snippets
- These are small parts of the mainline story that I wrote ahead of time because I was too excited to wait. These are all subject to revision and were mainly written for my own satisfaction.

### Tags

Short stories and writing snippets will have various tags to indicate their properties. Tags are subject to change.

- :octicons-verified-16: Canon
- A fully canonized and confirmed story.
- :octicons-unverified-16: Non-Canon
- Contains non canon elements.
- :material-star-three-points-outline: Mainline
- Writing that relates closely or is part of the mainline plot.
- :material-star-four-points-outline: Connected
- Writing that mentions/references mainline plot, or could explain parts of the mainline plot.
- :octicons-north-star-16: Disconnected
- Writing that has no connection to the mainline plot.
