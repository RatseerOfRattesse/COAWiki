Ritual diagrams shone across its hull, granting it the magic to cross between realities. For now, it was docked atop the sky-dome of Kaaldenvale, a reality encompassing just a single planet, doing nothing. For any other fringe interdimensional organization, this would be a massive and wasteful expenditure. But for the Haelborne, it was but one of their silent, thousand-strong fleet, out plundering the cosmos like the others.</p> <p>This particular mission, however, was quite special. Both in terms of the objective\u2026 and who was involved.</p> <p>Aboard the ship, in one of the lounges, was a fae and a dysphorium.</p> <p>The fae were the local intelligent species of Kaaldenvale, somewhat resembling the elves of Earth folklore. Unlike those nature spirits, they were built for killing, evolved from highly predatory mammals \u2013 they bore such features as retractable cat-like claws, razor-sharp flexible ears, and jagged rows of teeth. This particular fae was a relatively recent recruit to the Haelborne cause, specifically for this mission. He announced himself Limril, and proceeded to blunder his way through various social situations with unasked-for factoids.</p> <p>The dysphorium were nothing like the fae. A population of thousands scattered across the cosmos, with nowhere to call home, they roamed realities, slaughtering thousands with the power of an unchained soul. There was nothing keeping it from committing mass genocide on a whim, except for a lucrative deal.</p> <p>This dysphorium was a nightmarish concoction. It had serrated blades incorporated into its limbs. Its face was dominated by a wide, ever-grinning mouth of sharp teeth. Its deep blue-grey hair floated in nonexistent wind, parted by a pair of twisting horns. From the rightmost horn hung an hourglass filled with blood red sand. Its name was Grim.</p> <p>The two were playing a local board game. Limril was unusually enthused for his nonchalant and apathetic demeanour. Grim was alternately moving pieces and tasting them.</p> <p>\u201cDamnit,\u201d Limril sighed. \u201cGrim, can you not eat those?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could\u2026\u201d Grim spat a bunch of twisted wooden scraps out of its mouth. \u201cBut my contract tells me I have to not eat the people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is that relevant?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow helpful.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>Limril sighed again and swept the board and pieces off the table. He waved his hand, and the board hovered its way across the floor and into a cupboard. Eyes dulling, he snatched a can of soda out of nothingness, popping it open and downing a gulp.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said between sips. \u201cYou ready for dispatch to Javenshard this week?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat-shard?\u201d Grim mumbled, its grin fracturing back to a mildly triumphant smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s to eat there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJavenshard, Grim. A town. In Haelcrien. And you can\u2019t eat anyone until we get scouting done. And then we have to figure out the arrangement with the Felheils\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Grim blew a raspberry \u2013 which was quite odd looking, because it didn\u2019t have lips, and its tongue looked like a spiked mace made from red flesh.</p> <p>\u201cCan I go negotiate with those guys? I love eating \u2013 I mean EATING new people.\u201d</p> <p>Limril stared at it.</p> <p>\u201cFuck I said it twice. Anyway, why\u2019re we going there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Fundament Glass, Grim.

Completely hypothetically. Not everything is sarcasm. Don\u2019t be so cynical!... not that I can talk.</p> <p>I\u2019m writing this as I walk down a forest path with my sister. You might think this is a terrible idea and I should pay more attention while walking through a spooky scary forest infested with monsters and shit. No, I\u2019m good. As a tier seven in the Gov\u2019nance systems, I\u2019ve gotten a lot of attribute points, twenty-seven of which are in soul. I can multitask way better than a regular fae. Took Bia and I, what, six years? to level this high \u2013 we\u2019ve nearly reached tier eight too \u2013 and, oh, lemme tell ya, it\u2019s worth it.

And missing out.</p> <p>Bia\u2019s merrily skipping down the trail while still ranting about my social deficits \u2013 which I assure you do not exist. Bia\u2019s two years older than me \u2013 I\u2019m eighteen \u2013 and, contrary to the majority of sibling to sibling relationships, she\u2019s always the one annoying me, not the other way around. I\u2019m simply too dignified to give a shit about low hanging self assurement.</p> <p>Bia\u2019s real tall,  just over two metres. She has short but impeccably styled purple hair (a hallmark of the family). This is the Hastors\u2019 fae colour palette, so we all of have it \u2013 though I wear it better than Bia, of course. Mother has it too, even though she married in \u2013 I swear it\u2019s coincidence. I hope we\u2019re not inbred \u2013 Father did always say we were descended from royalty and those fuckers are notorious for it.

Our ears stretch out far longer than the average fae, expanding about ninety centimetres to either side (another hallmark of the Hastor line \u2013 we\u2019re really, uh, special). Three divots were carved into them from the bottom \u2013 ear shape was a feature unique to every fae, but the regs over there haven\u2019t got the length to really be all that unique. Again, we\u2019re special.</p> <p>Compared to Bia, I\u2019m some sort of gremlin. Height-wise, if that wasn\u2019t clear. I have to assume certain levels of disability in anybody reading this (because it\u2019s probably me).</p> <p>I\u2019m short for a fae, only one and a bit metres tall. My hair\u2019s longer, styled super weird with a braid and multiple blatant violations of the laws of physics. My ears droop downward a lot. My gear (the non-conjured parts anyway) a parka with selective armour plating, with a red scarf layered over it. Not the most resilient \u2013 thank wealth inequality for repair enchantments.</p> <p>\u201c... and that\u2019s why you suck and the gods hate you.\u201d</p> <p>I looked up.</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p> <p>I totally heard everything she said. It\u2019s just funnier to pretend I didn\u2019t.</p> <p>\u201cSmartass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBetter than dumbass,\u201d I grumbled, panning my eyes across the trees. \u201cSpeaking of which, you, and this idea.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019ll be fine!\u201d Bia replied, spreading her fingers. \u201cThe monsters here aren\u2019t even that high level. They\u2019re only tier\u2026 what, thirteen?\u201d I stare back with glaring intensity.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re tier seven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell isn\u2019t that just tragic! But please, shut up and do the scan already.\u201d</p> <p>Rolling my eyes, I summon a weapon with the snap of a finger. A dagger flickers into existence in my hands. Blade of deep purple crystal, with red trails shimmering throughout, twisting and swirling like hundreds of miniature snakes.</p> Ability: [Voidburst Dagger] (Conjuring) <p>Incantation: none.</p> <p>Cost: meagre mana</p> <p>Cooldown: none.</p> <p>Damage Output:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Meagre, scaling with tier</p> </li> <li> <p>Ethereal:</p> <ul> <li> <p>33.3% Void</p> </li> <li> <p>33.3% Light</p> </li> <li> <p>33.3% Reality</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Impact:</p> <ul> <li>Stabbing</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Effect:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tier I</p> <ul> <li> <p>Conjure a Voidburst Dagger</p> </li> <li> <p>Minor boost to mana pool, crit chance, and crit damage, scaling with tier.</p> </li> <li> <p>Dagger inflicts [Devitalized Manaturgy]</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tier IV</p> <ul> <li>Inflicts [Adverse Manaturgy].</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tier V</p> <ul> <li> <p>Inflicts [Vampiric Manaturgy]</p> </li> <li> <p>Consume health to increase damage by a percentage three times the health sacrificed.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tier VI</p> <ul> <li>If target is below a third of their mana pool, minor increase to global damage output, scaling with tier.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tier VII</p> <ul> <li>Increase mana cost to moderate to inflict [Harmonic Manaturgy] on caster and wielder.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Effect: [Devitalized Manaturgy] (Weakening) <p>Slowly drains mana at a rate of meagre mana/id.</p> Effect: [Adverse Manaturgy] (Damage) <p>When target uses mana, deal damage one twelfth of mana used.</p> Effect: [Vampiric Manaturgy] (Draining) <p>One fourth of mana removed from the target, whether by the target or through external activity, is given to the user.</p> <p>If mana is removed by [Devitalized Manaturgy], extraction increases to one third.</p> <p>If mana is removed while [Adverse Manaturgy] is in effect, extraction increases to one third.</p> <p>If both [Devitalized Manaturgy] and [Adverse Manaturgy] are used, extraction increases to one half.</p> Effect: [Harmonic Manaturgy] (Damage) <p>Increase damage of [Adverse Manaturgy] from summoning, casting, conjuring, and ritual type abilities by (target\u2019s tier) %.</p> <p>I twirl the dagger in a showy way, before sliding it into a scabbard on my belt. This bad boy had slain a lot of monsters and was one of the first abilities I\u2019d acquired, from back when we first immigrated to Haelcrien and mother still had the heart (and sanity, can\u2019t forget that part) to train me.</p> <p>From my belt pouch (extradimensional!!!) I take a metal tablet far larger than the pouch itself. I tap the tablet three times with a finger like I had done hundreds before. After a brief moment, lines engrave themselves into the metal, creating a radar interface. A quick scanning animation follows, before dots appear around the area. I tap the closest one.</p> Creature: [Crienbeast] (Beast) <p>Average Tier: III</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>A combination of rat and bear, with a bear\u2019s bulky body and fur, but a rat\u2019s tail and head.

She holds out her hand and chants:</p> <p>\u201cFallen horrors in the gloom, come forth and ferry my doom.\u201d</p> <p>Red mist coalesces in her palm before expanding to form a massive scythe, with a blade of crimson metal and grip of black hide.</p> Ability: [Fel Scythe] (Conjuring) <p>Incantation: Fallen horrors in the gloom, come forth and ferry my doom</p> <p>Cost: meagre mana</p> <p>Cooldown: none.</p> <p>Damage Output:</p> <ul> <li> <p>High, scaling with tier</p> </li> <li> <p>Ethereal:</p> <ul> <li> <p>50% Necrotic</p> </li> <li> <p>50% Bleed</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Impact:</p> <ul> <li>Cutting</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Effect:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tier I</p> <ul> <li>Conjure a Fel Scythe.

Continues to deal slowly deescalating damage for ten sec. before dropping off.</p> <p>Without another word, she dashes off into the forest, heading towards the pack of monsters ahead. Decimating local species time. I\u2019ve gotta write the rest of this after we finish fighting.</p> <p>I rolled my eyes, conjuring a pair of wings before launching after my sister.</p> Ability: [Wings of Equilibrium] (Utility) <p>Cost: meagre mana</p> <p>Cooldown: none.</p> <p>Damage Output:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Low, scaling with tier</p> </li> <li> <p>Ethereal:</p> <ul> <li> <p>50% Holy</p> </li> <li> <p>50% Unholy</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Impact:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Metaphysical</p> </li> <li> <p>Cutting</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Effect:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tier I</p> <ul> <li>Conjure a pair of mismatched wings.

As stressed as I was in this over-ranked area of the forest, the thrill of combat rushed me right into the zone. Brandishing my dagger, I immediately leapt at the nearest monster, the sheer force of the launch tearing the poor thing\u2019s head right off its body. It tumbled about for a few seconds while the rest of its Governance-given energy sapped away and it dissolved into a pile of assorted items. Normally monsters didn\u2019t dissolve so quickly, but I must\u2019ve hit that one too hard.</p> Governance <p>[Enemy selected]</p> Governance <p>[60%]</p> Governance <p>[20%]</p> Governance <p>[dead]</p> Governance <p>You have defeated: [Crienbeast]</p> <p>Bia dashed into the clearing just a moment later. Her scythe flashed into a black and red blur, whirling to spear three beasts through the stomach. Viscera spilled, tendons ripped, lots of other yummy fleshy things fell on the ground. Yet the three crienbeasts still stood, courtesy of their enhanced tier four attributes.</p> Governance <p>[Enemy selected] x3</p> Governance <p>[40%]</p> Governance <p>[dead]</p> Governance <p>You have defeated: [Crienbeast] x3</p> <p>The poor creatures scrambled to re-assert their position \u2013 but NOPE, \u2018cause I\u2019m here to kick ass and other body parts too. A swarm of light blades dislodged from my outstretched hand, trailing fire and burning through poor, weak flesh. A second volley ensured their demise with a bonus cremation (for free!).</p> Ability: [Rain of Light] (Attack) <p>Incantation: Let the blaze of dawn light the blasphemous mind</p> <p>Cost: meagre mana</p> <p>Cooldown: 30 sec.</p> <p>Damage Output:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Medium, scaling with tier</p> </li> <li> <p>Ethereal:</p> <ul> <li> <p>50% Light</p> </li> <li> <p>50% Flame</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Impact:</p> <ul> <li>Stabbing</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Effect:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tier I</p> <ul> <li>Conjure a swarm of light spears.

Rocks and chunks of earth lifted as they ran, the spines across their backs lighting up a soft green as the debris shot forward. That was a neat little ability of theirs \u2013 manipulating gravity in a small area around them. Anyway, let\u2019s let the little cuties run around a little more. It gets boring from here.</p> <p>Within the span of a minute, the entire pack lay dead and disembowelled across the forest floor.</p> Governance <p>You have defeated: [Crienbeast] x6</p> <p>Ooh, aren\u2019t the wafting scents of burnt flesh so nice in the pristine outside air? I know, they really are.</p> <p>Leaves crunched as I stepped to the nearest body. I tapped a finger to the beast\u2019s temple, brushing the thing\u2019s fur with pleasure \u2013 there was loot to come.</p> Loot 1x [Crienbeast Tier IV]? <p>I ignored the Governance window and proceeded to tap the other corpses, as Bia did likewise on the other side of the clearing. Windows stacked up rapidly before they consolidating into one.</p> Loot 10x [Crienbeast Tier V]? <p>I mentally accepted the prompt, and ten bodies dissolved with a poof, leaving piles of neatly packaged monster parts scattered across the ground. Sheets of leather, bags of fur, bundled claws and spines. From Bia\u2019s position came another poof, quickly followed by a whoop of surprise.</p> <p>\u201cHoh!\u201d Bia called from across the clearing. \u201cThis guy dropped a core!\u201d</p> <p>I immediately spun around. In Bia\u2019s hand was what looked like a mangled electrical component, composed of a cube-shaped body and tangles of metal wire. Within the core shone a pulsing multicoloured light. These little things were manifestations of the Governance and were embedded in the bodies of all monsters it spawned. Rarely however, did one come out of the process in a usable state.</p> <p>I did not see what I just described, however. In Bia\u2019s hands was a pile of shining silver coins.</p> Item: [Depleted Lesser Governance Core] (Core) <p>Tier: IV</p> <p>Previously a [Lesser Governance Core], depleted after being used to construct a monster. Can be repurposed as a ritual or artifice component.</p> <p>\u201cNice.\u201d I shrugged, returning to collecting the other drops. I stuffed them all into a second belt pouch. Claws and fur, despite being too large to fit through the opening, simply shrunk as they approached the pouch before slotting into the dark space inside.</p> Item: [Extradimensional Sack] (Bag) <p>Tier: VII</p> <p>Manufactured by: Scruff &amp; Grime Leathers</p> <p>A simple run of the mill leather bag- but bigger on the inside. Item capacity: 40 m.3</p> <p>We gathered up the rest of the free money and trekked back into the trees and off to the shallower parts of the woods.</p> <p>\u201cWoo! What a haul!\u201d  Bia exclaimed excitedly. She snatched a metal tablet out of her own belt pouch, fingers flitting about across its surface in practiced motion, cataloguing our operation today. \u201cTwo commissions taken, and a ton of bonus loot. Ari \u2013 aye \u2013 whaddya say we take a day off tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>I just stared silently at the dome of scattered lights in the sky. Sorry Bia, I tune out a lot. This late in the day, the stars cast dim orange light onto the ground, though some of them had turned off entirely.</p> <p>\u201cHuh? Oh,\u201d I muttered, returning her gaze to the forest in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s almost stardown. We should go faster.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoring,\u201d Bia chimed out, sliding the tablet away and jamming her hands in her pockets in a popping motion. \u201cNightime\u2019s fun! That\u2019s when all the real spooping monsters come out!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cY\u2019know, I have a mild suspicion that that\u2019s definitely not a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun. I\u2019m going to leave now, meet you at home later!\u201d</p> <p>In one movement spanning less than a second, she had completely disappeared from sight. With a blink, I pulled at the energy behind my eyes. A red sigil appeared in my vision, becoming smaller as it mapped itself onto my retreating sister\u2019s back.</p> <p>\u201cVery funny!\u201d I called. \u201cGet back here!\u201d</p> <p>There was no response. The sigil became smaller, but I could still see in perfect clarity. Perks of levelling so high.</p> <p>\u201cBia!\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cBIA!\u201d</p> <p>I sighed and continued through the melancholic forest. I walked at a leisurely pace, trying to conjure up some thoughts in my solitude. But my mind was empty. Adamantly content to simply observe the world.</p> <p>I should stop being poetic.</p> <p>Nah, fuck that.</p> <p>Trees stretched into unidentifiable shapes.</p> <p>Leaves chattered in whispers of forgotten languages.</p> <p>Birds chirped and called distantly.</p> <p>The shadows seemed\u2026 particularly mocking. Like a really really expressive chandelier.</p> <p>And then everything stopped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the- \u201c</p> <p>At first, I thought I\u2019d gone deaf. In a place a tier zero would hear nothing, a tier seven could hear the smallest flickers in the environment, from the crawling of insects across the mildewed surfaces to the dripping of minuscule waters from trees to soft dirt.</p> <p>But no, it wasn\u2019t me.</p> <p>Silence rang in an almost tangible wave. Something was wrong, something fundamental. I summoned my dagger, slowly turning on the spot, scanning the trees. Nothing else dared move or make noise as a Presence settled over the forest. I couldn\u2019t distinguish any of its elements. It was a maelstrom of madness, merry and ecstatic with the cold promise of eternal unexistence.</p> <p>I blinked, expecting another red sigil to appear. Nothing.</p> <p>There were two explanations for this.</p> <p>A: Something is nearby. Something far more powerful than myself. More powerful than anything I had ever fought, judging by what I felt in that Presence.</p> <p>B: I am tripping balls.</p> <p>My eyes slashed across the trees, picking out anything out of place before spotting it: a faint blur speeding forward. Cracks and groans echoed from its position as if reality strained where it stepped.</p> <p>It was way too fast for me to run away. At least tier fourty based on that one time I watched skilled adventurers fighting higher-tier monsters in Troltano. I couldn\u2019t match its physical speed, but I had years of combat experience. On pure instinct \u2013 without even a thought \u2013 an array of translucent blue shields sprang up in front of me, just in time to meet a swarm of metal blades.</p> Ability: [Shattersweep Shield] (Defence) <p>Incantation: none</p> <p>Cost: meagre mana</p> <p>Cooldown: 30 sec.</p> <p>Damage Output:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Low, scaling with tier</p> </li> <li> <p>Ethereal:</p> <ul> <li> <p>90% Light</p> </li> <li> <p>10% Mystic</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Impact:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Blunt</p> </li> <li> <p>Stabbing</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Effect:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Tier I</p> <ul> <li>Conjure a floating shield.

You can chain-conjure up to six shields, but each one will be less effective than a regular one.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tier IV</p> <ul> <li>Throw the shield as a projectile, periodically stunning and knocking back anything in its path. Shards detach from the main shield as it moves, each dealing moderate stabbing damage.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tier VI</p> <ul> <li>Merge up to three shields to form a larger shield. Larger shields cannot be used as projectiles but will follow user and can be moved in a small radius around the user.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tier VII</p> <ul> <li>You may now conjure up to twelve shields, each at the base mana cost.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Effect: [Fracture] (Weakening) <p>Target becomes more susceptible to ethereal damage and is occasionally hit with some void damage and multiplies this effect. Effect stacks.</p> <p>The shields shattered. Stupid me, assuming my puny tier seven power could hold up to random tentacle monsters.</p> <p>Blue shards danced outwards explosively before dissolving. In the split second time it took for the strikes to break through, I pulled my arms up to block the strike \u2013 and had them utterly eviscerated.</p> <p>Blood spattered everywhere, strips of flesh peeling away. Tendons slithered out of my scrambled arms, pain flaring as the copper smell of blood wilted away from ripped meat.</p> <p>So much useless, powerless meat.</p> Governance <p>HP: [50%]</p> <p>I stood there for a few seconds, almost disbelievingly.</p> <p>It had been so long since I\u2019d seen my own blood.</p> <p>\u201cShit\u2026\u201d</p> <p>It was at this point that poor little Aryon Hastor realized\u2026 that she had supremely fucked up.</p> <p>I glanced up at the monster.</p> <p>\u201cShit, shit, shit, shit.\u201d</p> <p>Eight eyes glowed with bright red glee, arranged in a circle surrounding a gaping jaw of metallic teeth. Dark hair floated in flailing strands, drifting through a nonexistent wind.</p> <p>Why wasn\u2019t it attacking?</p> <p>Oh yeah. This would be a supremely comedic moment when it slapped me sixteen metres backwards through seventeen trees. I should probably\u2026 run?</p> <p>\u201cNope, nope \u2013 NOPE, GOODBYE!\u201d I screamed as I conjured my wings and launched into the sky. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just be going this way now and you\u2019re not gonna get anywhere closer or I don\u2019t damn know what I\u2019ll do MAYBE I SHOULD STOP HYPERVENTILATING AND FUCKING RUN!\u201d</p> <p>The whistling of wind through metal sounded as black tendrils topped with wicked blades surfaced around me. The entity barrelled upwards, closer, closer, closer and closer. I turned around just long enough for the Governance to analyze the monster. A window appeared in the corner of my vision. It didn\u2019t help \u2013 in fact, I was now MORE panicked.</p> Being: [Unknown] (Dysphorium (Alt. 3152)) <p>[Obfuscated]</p> <p>Entity does not have a root in Governance system</p> <p>Entity shares foreign magic system equivalent of your title [Dormant]</p> <p>\u201cWHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!!!! WHAT ARE YOU??!!!!!!!\u201d I half cried. I flung light blades at the thing, screaming and crying my way upwards. Cackling drifted through the rancid air as a massive metal claw snatched me downwards. Debris detonated from the impact as I was slammed against a tree. The entity didn\u2019t move it\u2019s main body, instead pushing me up the trunk with the claw attached to its tentacle.</p> <p>It rattled its way closer, taking its time. Its Presence grew stronger, the layers of reality bending and warping as it slashed forwards, limbs distending with snaps and crackles. Finally, it reached the foot of the tree. Its head snapped upwards, eyes piercing my skull as it concentrated its Presence towards me. This was a technique only known by the most elite of adventurers. No sound could escape my lips.</p> <p>\u201cHello there!\u201d the entity cheered happily, like a preschooler with a new toy. \u201cI\u2019m Grim!\u201d</p> <p>Silence. I physically could not talk \u2013 the Presence still screaming in my veins.</p> <p>\u201cOh, not up for a talk then? Funny! Straight to the chase then\u2026\u201d Grim\u2019s eye sockets narrowed. It had no pupils, but this still achieved a look of persecution \u2013 or, to be less descriptive, a look of \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you and everyone you love and then I\u2019m going to steal your tendons to make a blanket.\u2019 \u201cWould you be so kind as to hand over the Firmament Hourglass?\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>The Presence relaxed slightly.</p> <p>The Presence relaxed slightly.</p> <p>The Presence relaxed slightly.</p> <p>\u201cW-what?\u201d I shuddered, heart pounding through my chest. The trinket under my scarf seemed to become heavier.</p> <p>Grim\u2019s eyes narrowed further. It sighed and dragged its hand upwards. It had no fingers \u2013 the end of its forearm instead hosted three serrated, articulated metal claws. With a movement faster than I could see, it pulled my necklace out from under my scarf. At the end of the chain was that tiny hourglass, filled with blood red sand.</p> <p>Oh, oh yeah. I definitely know what it wants.</p> <p>\u201cThis little trinket around your neck, of course!\u201d</p> <p>So, I was stuck in a very bad position. I could be loyal and keep the treasure my clinically insane mother had adamantly told me several thousand times not to lose \u2013 or I could save my own life.</p> <p>Wanna guess which one I went with?</p> <p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d</p> <p>This was a completely rational and logical decision. You can imagine me giving a thumbs up right now.</p> <p>The Presence returned in an instant, a reality-shattering aura thundering into place. Screams and wails echoed through my ears, the smell of soot and ash burning through my skull like the spilled internal bodily fluids of hundreds of ended lives. Another tentacle, this one topped with a massive scythe, unlatched itself from Grim\u2019s back and ripped into my chest. Frankly, it was a miracle I was still alive. Tier seven blood coursed out of the wound, the vital force keeping her together spilling by the litre.</p> Governance <p>HP: [40%]</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps I was not clear enough?\u201d Grim cackled. \u201cHonestly man, I\u2019m STARVING. Best give me the little thingy or I\u2019ll be forced to \u2013 eheheh \u2013 have a snack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to uh \u2013 uh \u2013 go somewhere, I have \u2013 like, an appointment with my\u2026 anarchist!\u201d</p> <p>Grim raised another claw-hand. It dug further into my ribcage, tossing out various organs before picking up my heart and casually popping it into its mouth.</p> Governance <p>HP: [5%]</p> <p>I had no lungs to scream. No biggie. I\u2019m sure everything will turn out okay. Sarcastic optimism is my coping mechanism!</p> <p>\u201cRelinquish the hourglass please,\u201d Grim chittered, its tone as goofy as ever. \"I need your soul\u2019s permission.\"</p> <p>I could only cough and splutter. This, however, was an advanced battle tactic known as DECEPTION, BITCH!</p> <p>This method is also known as saving your most powerful move until the end of the fight for dramatic effect and definitely not because I\u2019m too much of scaredy cat to manage logical thinking in a near death situation.</p> <p>I raised a hand in a casting position, pointed at Grim. Four fingers stretched out as far forward as possible, the pinky folded backwards across the bottom of the thumb. There was a moment of silence, as Grim curiously tilted its head. Ooh, it had no idea.</p> <p>I pulled at the energy under my eyes. Four red circles burned indents into my thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers. I grunted in pain.</p> <p>Tendrils of piercing red light blasted from my fingers. Crackling erupted at an ear-piercing pitch as the red lightning shot towards Grim and sent the thing flying off hundreds of kilometres into the horizon. Panting, I fell to the ground, clutching the gaping hole in my chest. The flesh had already started to knit back together \u2013 thank the Immortals for ranked-up healing kicking in.</p> <p>Crawling into a comfortable position, I reached into my extradimensional pouch, fumbling about before snatching out a massive bottle. It had an unbalanced top and bottom, almost like one of those kids\u2019 science worksheets we did in first grade.</p> <p></p> Item: [Reinforced Glass Bottle] (Container) <p>Tier: VII</p> <p>Contains: [Greater Sustenance Elixir]</p> <p>Manufactured by: Five Brothers Alchemical Goods</p> <p>A glass bottle with magical reinforcements, meant to contain powerful potions.</p> Potion: [Greater Sustenance Elixir] (Restoration) <p>Tier: VII</p> <p>Manufactured by: Five Brothers Alchemical Goods</p> <p>A potion that can completely restore missing health and mana.</p> <p>I ripped off the cork and downed all the silver liquid inside. My wounds healed even faster, flesh and sinew flashing and flailing until it looked like there was never any damage at all. It was half a minute before I moved. Even though it had physically healed me, it wasn\u2019t able to cure exhaustion.</p> <p>Once the potion had done its job, I shambled upright. Again lifting an arm in casting position, I waved it in a ring and the red energy cut a hole in the world. Through the tear was my bedroom \u2013 not that my dreary state could interpret what I was seeing. This entire portal wasn\u2019t even a conscious action. On instinct, I needed my bed. I slouched through the portal, collapsing on the plank floor of the room, before rolling to stare upwards. My vision faded to black, the last thing I saw the tinkling of candlelight against the grey ceiling.</p>"},{"location":"Story/Mainline%20Story/Advent%20of%20the%20Haelborne/#chapter-ii-vacation","title":"Chapter II: Vacation...?","text":"<p>do I at least get paid</p> <p></p> <p>The slamming of a door some distance away snapped me out of unconsciousness. I was lying across the wood-panelled floor of my bedroom, surrounded by a ring of ripped flesh and dried blood. Likely discarded material from after the potion kicked in. I glanced at the walls, clustered with shelves and shelves of assorted books, monster skulls, and my paintings of the Javenshard wilderness. Silently, I clambered upright, only to collapse against the wall next to the door. With a jerking motion, I slammed open the door with a slap of the hand, throwing myself against the upstairs railing as if fired from a slingshot. Movement with a fully repaired body after being recently near-deceased is a little tricky.</p> <p>A coughing fit ensued as I snapped up to take the stairs down before \u2013</p> <p>\u201cAri!\u201d Bia\u2019s voice sang loudly from below. \u201cYou in here?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d I spluttered, dragging my feet as I staggered down to our living room. Bia stood next to the table, looking expectantly at the stairs. Her grin faded. A terrible omen \u2013 Bia is always making that evil grin of hers.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Bia immediately dropped all pretence of her usual giddiness. \u201cI just got back from stealing Dan\u2019s bottles, what did you do?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got attacked by a demon, that\u2019s what!\u201d I refueled with energy, glaring daggers at Bia. \u201cThis is why we don\u2019t go ANYWHERE near the deep woods. While you were off pilfering the pub, I was getting mauled against by a bleeding ten foot tall metal monster!\u201d</p> <p>Bia paused, a rare look of hesitation on her face.</p> <p>\u201cAnd\u2026 what monster was it?\u201d</p> <p>Wordlessly, I sent over the Governance profile generated for the entity. With that done, I fell violently onto the couch, lying there contemplatively. In retrospect, the entire scene was a little kooky; it looked as if Bia was running a therapy session (which, Immortals forbid, she was definitely not qualified to do).</p> <p>Bia read over the profile several times, eyes seeing but not comprehending \u2013 though that\u2019s what she usually did. Dumbass.</p> &gt; Item mailed from [Aryon Hastor] <p>Being: [Unknown] (Dysphorium (Alt. 3152))</p> <p>[Obfuscated]</p> <p>Entity does not have a root in Governance system</p> <p>Entity shares foreign magic system equivalent of your title [Dormant]</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Not rooted in Governance system?\u2019 And it shares your Dormant title, but in another magic system?\u201d She coughed nervously. \u201cLast I checked, we\u2019re not living in a fantasy novel, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow in the twelve hells am I supposed to know?\u201d I hyperventilated. \u201cIt hit me twice and I was near dead, I wasn\u2019t contemplating the existence of something that isn\u2019t compatible with the system our society has grown with since \u2013 since the Miruen Empire!\u201d</p> <p>Bia stared out the living room window at the black night. You could just barely see the houses along our street.</p> <p>\u201cWe should tell someone this thing is in the forest. Nothing tier thirteen should be able to take out Ms. Perfect Hastor that easily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing at all should be able to take out any Hastor that easily,\u201d I said, the still-lingering panic overriding her name calling. \u201cHow it even got through my passive sensory is a complete mystery. And who would we tell? You think the mayor of this dump can do anything about it? We specifically picked a low rank place like Javenshard to settle down \u2013 so we wouldn\u2019t have to deal with crazy stuff like this!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou specifically picked Javenshard so you wouldn\u2019t have to deal with crazy stuff like this,\u201d Bia rolled her eyes, and added in a mutter. \u201cCoward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou shut it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you,\u201d She retorted with a natural cadence. That was one of her most used phrases, and it was so very annoying. \u201cWe can travel over to Troltano and go tell Father ourselves. Or find someone high-tier to take out the thing \u2013 Troltano is a tier fifty-sixty area.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going all the way out there while that demon is still around.\u201d</p> <p>Bia raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy? It\u2019s just a monster. It\u2019ll find other prey and should know better than to go near busy, established roads, much less follow you about.\u201d</p> <p>I opened her mouth, then closed it, then sighed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not after me. It\u2019s after Mother\u2019s hourglass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou- \u201c Bia spluttered. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s sentient? It\u2019s not an actual monster?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Monsters are fabricated by the Governance to feed faevinity experience, you know this? So, what kind of monster is intelligently motivated not by sadism, but by a specific shiny trinket?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would it want the hourglass? The thing can\u2019t use the glass\u2019 powers, can it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t think so. It didn\u2019t show off any reality-bending. But hells, I don\u2019t know! It\u2019s a spooky shadow demon, we didn\u2019t learn about those in adventuring school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201dCheck the glass. Is there something on it? Some kind of tracking device? Anything?\u201d</p> <p>I gently pulled out the hourglass from my shirt. The blood red sands tinkled softly as the trinket moved.</p> Item: [Old Hourglass] (Accessory) <p>Tier: I</p> <p>A family heirloom of the Hastor line. Do not lose it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still the same as ever,\u201d I sighed, disappointed. \u201cPerhaps I should report this to someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still the same as ever,\u201d I sighed, disappointed. \u201cPerhaps I should report this to someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still the same as ever,\u201d I sighed, disappointed. \u201cPerhaps I should report this to someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAri you selectively deaf dumbass I said that a minute ago.\u201d Bia exclaimed. \u201cIf that thing gets into Javenshard it\u2019s going to obliterate everyone. Nobody here is high enough tier to even stand in front of it. Except for Mother, but you know what she\u2019s been like since\u2026\u201d</p> <p>I groaned. \u201cY\u2019know, I could just send Father a letter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you know what he\u2019s like too. He won\u2019t listen to us unless we go slap in him the face ourselves. Besides, a trip will be fun! We\u2019ve been cooped up here for years, we gotta go somewhere else eventually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the matter of the murder monster after my face?\u201d I glared.</p> <p>Bia smiled sweetly, leaned forward.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine. Can we just have a regular, fun, vacation...?\u201d</p> <p>I only glared harder, purple pupils boring past a sheaf of hair and straight into Bia\u2019s eyes. After a second of silence in which you could practically hear the cartoonishly escalating sound effect-</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d I relented. \u201cI suppose it was about time I fought something higher rank.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHells yeah!\u201d Bia pumped her fist. \u201cNice. We should leave\u2026 tomorrow morning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair enough. I don\u2019t have much to pack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019ll call on Golden Boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLloyd? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, and the Verosavens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to bring them along too?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019ll be a fun little vacation!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d I started, extremely unenthused. \u201cWell\u2026 as far as I care it\u2019s purely business. And Dan and Rosa are tier threes with non-combat specialties. They won\u2019t last long if that thing comes after us, or if we\u2019re out hunting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey can sit the fighting out,\u201d Bia shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cIf the thing\u2019s after your hourglass it won\u2019t care about them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut \u2013 you - whatever\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Bia pumped her fist again. It was extensively rare for me to put up with her bullshit, much less agree with said bullshit. A victory for her \u2013 I\u2019d do something petty about it but I\u2019m too exhausted from almost fucking dying. Grinning, Bia stalked over to the stairs and began climbing.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna go get some sleep,\u201d she chittered. \u201cI\u2019d suggest you do that too. We\u2019re leaving seven in the morning tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNoon,\u201d I called, my gaze not leaving the ceiling as Bia ascended the staircase.</p> <p>\u201cNine!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNoon, Bia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p> <p>Bia laughed and vanished upstairs.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I stalked my way through the forest trail, legs ripping right through the thorns and brambles. Weak early morning sunlight shone through the forest canopy, lighting up the blooming flowers scattered throughout the underbrush. Small streams ran about the weeds, blighting the dirt with moisture. Though I was reluctant to leave the vicinity of Javenshard, I suppose we had earned a vacation. I\u2019d worked hard to keep adventuring, and Bia\u2026 ahh, Bia did her best. I sound like Mother. Speaking of\u2026</p> <p>Her cabin was nestled in a jungle of bushes and vines. Stepping over a discarded watering can and towards the door, the soggy wooden steps creaked under my boots. I paused, cringed, but continued on. I knocked thrice.</p> <p>For a moment, there was silence. I edged backwards against the rain-soaked railing.</p> <p>Brisk footsteps tapped their way forward and paused too, and then the door swung open.</p> <p>Duskir Hastor was seventy years old, but she looked only thirty thanks to a hard-earned tier sixty-seven life force. She still had at least a century left \u2013 one of the reasons many fae devoted themselves to ranking up. Eighty years always felt too short for me, even with my own extra time.</p> <p>Mother wore a colourful poncho over a generic set of casual clothing. Her hair was deep purple like all the Hastors. Wild, violet eyes darted around the forest, unable to focus.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Ari,\u201d Duskir mumbled, still looking everywhere but at me. \u201cWhat brings you to my cabin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a request for you,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Duskir looked around hesitantly.</p> <p>\u201cMother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2026come in.\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>She scrambled back into the house and slammed the door. Typical Mother. I opened the door again and stepped inside, carefully closing it behind me. Duskir sat in a rocking chair in front of a table, which was placed uncannily in the centre of the room. She never lit it; the crystal matrix kept the cabin heated had been on for years and I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d forgotten it existed. There was only one other chair in the room; Duskir didn\u2019t have guests. I sat casually.</p> <p>\u201cSo, dear,\u201d Duskir asked mechanically. \u201cWhat bothers you?\u201d</p> <p>I leaned forward conspiratorially.</p> <p>\u201cI was attacked in the forest last night. By something that shouldn\u2019t have been in there. Something nobody in Javenshard can fight, except for you.\u201d</p> <p>Duskir\u2019s eyes narrowed, a rare spark of sanity entering her gaze.</p> <p>\u201cShow me your logs.\u201d</p> <p>I mailed over the entity\u2019s Governance description.</p> &gt; Item mailed from [Aryon Hastor] <p>Being: [Unknown] (Dysphorium (Alt. 3152))</p> <p>[Obfuscated]</p> <p>Entity does not have a root in Governance system</p> <p>Entity shares foreign magic system equivalent of your title [Dormant]</p> <p>\u201cWhat in the\u2026\u201d Duskir glared at the message accusatorially. She sprang up, hands drooping oddly at the sides. \u201cYou aren\u2019t pranking me, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you fight that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, and I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what is it?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said you knew!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve met it, but I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p> <p>I groaned. With Mother, it was more likely she had known but forgot.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I said in exasperation. With a flourish, I lifted the hourglass necklace over my head and placed it on the coffee table. \u201cWhat can you tell me about this?\u201d</p> <p>Duskir leaned forward.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I said in exasperation. With a flourish, I lifted the hourglass necklace over my head and placed it on the coffee table. \u201cWhat can you tell me about this?\u201d</p> <p>Duskir leaned forward.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I said in exasperation. With a flourish, I lifted the hourglass necklace over my head and placed it on the coffee table. \u201cWhat can you tell me about this?\u201d</p> <p>Duskir leaned forward.</p> <p>The sands tinkled softly.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2026\u201d Duskir started. \u201cThat\u2019s the Hastor hourglass. You know what that is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me, is it valuable?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooking to sell it?\u201d Her eyes narrowed dangerously \u2013 though her pupils still didn\u2019t focus. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow tragic,\u201d I said in deadpan. \u201cHere, Mother, would you like a drink?\u201d</p> <p>I reached into my dimensional sack and pulled out a filled teacup, handing it to Duskir.</p> Item: [Polished Teacup] (Silverware) <p>Tier: Zero</p> <p>Contains: Bottled Truth</p> <p>Manufactured by: Drehmali Southern Utilities</p> <p>A simple and effective teacup.</p> <p>Enchantments: Disguise I</p> Enchantment: [Disguise] (Deception) <p>Effects:</p> <p>Change the name of an item or other valid Governance entry of or connected to enchanted item.</p> Potion: [Bottled Truth] (Deceptive) <p>Tier: L</p> <p>Produced by: Altegan Alchemical</p> <p>Induces a trance-like state that forces the user to tell the truth.</p> <p>Duskir gazed at it until it her own Governance instance analyzed it. I\u2019m not the best with anything other than fighting, really, so I\u2019d been up all last night trying to fix this thing up. Quite proud of the results. Of course, I didn\u2019t brew the potion, just did the enchantment. Tier fifty is too high for a measly tier seven like myself with mediocre brewing skills.</p> Item: [Polished Teacup] (Silverware) <p>Tier: Zero</p> <p>Contains: Roriodoan Tea</p> <p>Manufactured by: Drehmali Southern Utilities</p> <p>A simple and effective teacup.</p> Potion: [Roriodoan Tea] (Tea) <p>Tier: Zero</p> <p>Manufactured by: Roriodo Farms Inc.</p> <p>A soft tea produced from the meadows of the Roriodo River.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Ari,\u201d she said, taking a sip. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved the local teas. They taste\u2026 honest\u2026 \u2026honest\u2026 \u2026honest\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d I said mock-professionally. \u201cIn fact, I brewed some of this myself. I\u2019m learning, aye?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it tastes wonderful, dear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course it does, I made it,\u201d Oof. Shouldn\u2019t have said that. \u201cNow, what can you tell me about the hourglass?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old family heirloom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd where did the Hastors get it?\u201d</p> <p>Duskir\u2019s eyes suddenly sharpened again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to disclose that information.\u201d</p> <p>But my eyes sharpen better. That\u2019s completely irrelevant, but I\u2026 I don\u2019t know what my point here is, actually. This is a dead end. Here, have some more cool dialogue.</p> <p>\u201cWhy, have another sip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pa\u2013 \u201c</p> <p>A line of red lightning sprang from my fingers, snapping Duskir\u2019s arms in place.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>My other hand sparked lightning, picking up the teacup and tipping it down her throat.</p> Title: [Reality Warper] <p>Gives the user the ability to manipulate reality. This title is unrestricted but does not draw on mana, rather the user\u2019s soul itself. Due to the stress it puts on the soul, it effectively grows in strength as the user\u2019s soul does. Reality manipulation includes: reshaping/repurposing matter, duplicating matter, voiding matter, conjuring matter, and more.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is the hourglass from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was procured by Matriarch Raelia,\u201d Duskir spoke, her voice now lacking what little cadence it had before.</p> <p>\u201cAnd who is Raelia?\"</p> <p>\u201cThat \u2013 that is\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUseful to me,\u201d I growled. The teacup tipped more potion into Duskir\u2019s mouth. She went limp, twitching as she spoke.</p> <p>\u201cShe arrived in the northern lands of the old Miruen Empire \u2013 just before the Empire itself fell. The first of the Hastor line. She claimed to be a deific entity and was the first of our line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, one of them con artists then,\u201d I remarked, hands fidgeting with a spark of reality energy. It dissipated against my chair armrest. \u201cDoes the hourglass do anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs far as I know, it only enhances reality-bending abilities,\u201d Duskir\u2019s voice seemed to be sputtering out. Possibly a bad sign? Nah, it\u2019s fine. \u201cIt allows us to use them for longer without spontaneously combusting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s very enlightening Mother, I already knew that. So why do I have it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am to pass it down to the next eligible Hastor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not Bia?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe refused it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time here, I was confused. I couldn\u2019t see Bia \u2013 or anyone \u2013 turning down something like that. Hells, I\u2019ll take any free item to even slightly enhance my abilities. More efficient monster hunting, more money.</p> <p>\u201cWell, this has been somewhat productive.\u201d I gestured towards the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to... leave.\u201d</p> <p>I waved and left the cabin.</p> <p>I pondered the information I\u2019d stolen from Mother. I felt a little bad, feeding her a potion like that, but it was the easiest way to get to what I needed. Though, now that I think it over, this information wasn\u2019t worth much. It\u2019s nothing pivotal. She\u2019s just told me some generic worldbuilding crap that isn\u2019t useful to the plot. Why does Grim want this thing? It\u2019s just some old shiny trinket that it can\u2019t even use because it doesn\u2019t have the Hastors\u2019 specific abilities.</p> <p>It has to have some sort of agenda. Or is it working under someone else\u2019s agenda???</p> <p>Grim was insanely powerful. If it was working for something else, what kind of power did they have?</p> <p>***</p> <p>I sat on a stool in the Bearcroft Inn. No one else was in the building, as it was several hours before the usual opening time at noon. The inn was owned by Dan Verosaven, one of my childhood friends and one of the three Bia had invited along on their trip. We were supposed to meet here at seven with all our stuff packed (and with \u2018a good attitude\u2019, said Bia). Despite my previous complaint abouting getting up so early, I\u2019d somehow ended up here before everyone else.</p> <p>I was drowsily slouched over the bar, reading a book and only comprehending half the words. A shot glass was left empty on the counter. I had no reservations about drinking \u2013 good ol\u2019 tier seven me was more than capable of processing alcohol in far larger doses than a regular normie fae. The headache and insomnia were more a result of the brutal beating from Grim. Magical healing was intensely potent at fixing physical damage, but often caused minor aftereffects as backlash.</p> <p>The creaking of the half-polished front door roused me from my half-sleep.</p> <p>\u201cWoah, early today?\u201d Bia called dryly. \u201cNot slacking? Who, Aryon?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Ari,\u201d Dan followed with his scruffy, deep voice.</p> <p>The Verosaven family was descended from an older line of craftsmen dynasties, all of which had a dark bluish-grey hair and bright orange eye colour. Dan was a twenty year old fae, with voluminous hair and a small beard, with a noble facial structure and eyes that were either expressly bored or jovially amused. His ears were regular fae length, just ten centimetres. A single barb hung at the ends of his ears, curving upwards to meet a strangely blocky formation. He wore a dishevelled tweed jacket over some casual clothes, his hands stuck firmly in his pant pockets.</p> <p>\u201cAhh!\u201d I called. \u201cGood morning Dan. Where\u2019s Rosa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo \u2018good morning\u2019 for me?\u201d Bia asked in mock hurt. \u201cI\u2019m offended.\u201d</p> <p>Dan shook his head and walked over to the counter to set down his backpack.</p> <p>\u201cBe offended,\u201d I scoffed. \u201cIt makes me feel better.\u201d</p> <p>Bia raised a finger and was about to speak before the door slammed open and right into her face.</p> <p>\u201cWHAT\u2019S UP?\u201d A voice screamed at the top of her lungs.</p> <p>Rosalith Verosaven pranced in with her usual over energetic demeanour, spinning and waving her arms like maniac, blue-grey ponytail flailing about like a whip. She wore a baggy bright orange hoodie, obscuring her one and a half metre frame. Rosa was the youngest of our group, born three years earlier than her brother. Her ears were a short six centimetres.</p> <p>Funny little thing about the Verosavens. Back when they had Dan, they were kinda struggling for money. Lower class families here in this continent named their children with less syllables than higher classes. Then, a few years later, they sorta stumbled into a bit of an absolute bloody fortune just lying in the woods. Some kind of fully intact Governance component left behind by some monster.</p> <p>It was around this time they had Rosa, and with their newfound fortune they could afford some more syllables. Of course, it\u2019s not like they actually had to buy longer names. Just a culture thing that everyone respects around here - plus, it makes a goofy little anecdote I can use to break up the monotony of these idiots\u2019 dialogue.</p> <p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Bia moaned in pain, creaking upright and rubbing her nose.</p> <p>Dan waved silently from behind the counter, not looking up from whatever he was retrieving from the cabinet.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hello Rosa,\u201d I said. She glared at Bia, slumped against the wall, her groans getting steadily more comical. \u201cShut it, you. You\u2019re tier seven, stop being theatrical.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTheatrical?!\u201d Bia decried. \u201cWhy, I am in utmost pain! Have you no respect for the needy-\u201c</p> <p>A blade of light swung outwards from my wrist, stabbing into the wood next to Bia\u2019s throat with a twang. The quiet noise of simmering wood filled the room for a brief few seconds before the blade disintegrated.</p> <p>\u201cAs I said,\u201d Ari cooed, miming blowing steam off a gun. \u201cShut your oral aperture in punctual time, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHypocrite,\u201d Bia muttered. \u201cAnd a pedant too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs I said,\u201d Ari cooed, miming blowing steam off a gun. \u201cShut your oral aperture in punctual time, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHypocrite,\u201d Bia muttered. \u201cAnd a pedant too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAri, please don\u2019t fuck up my walls,\u201d Dan chuckled, going back to his counter before popping out with a closed sign. \u201cAh, here we are,\u201d he continued to the silent room. He walked over to the front door and hung the sign across the door.</p> <p>BEARCROFT INN CLOSED RENT IS NO LONGER DUE</p> <p>Dan slowly walked over to a seat and sat down, pulling out a notepad and pencil.</p> <p>\u201cAhem,\u201d Rosa loudly cleared her throat. \u201cSo\u2026 Bia, where\u2019re we off ta? Ya said Ari had to go report some kinda HOA bullshit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s extremely inaccurate,\u201d I laughed. \u201cI was attacked by a demon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpooky.\u201d Rosa said in a bored voice. \u201cSo, yes, HOA bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of logic - \u201c \u201cA pair of large, obese ls.\u201d I dragged a hand over my face. Rosalith was equal parts annoying and enjoyable in conversation.</p> <p>\u201cRosa, you didn\u2019t steal some of my stock too didya?\u201d Dan called, then pointed at Bia. \u201cAnd I know what you did last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely no idea what you are talking about, Dan,\u201d Bia said cheerfully.</p> <p>\u201cOkay then\u2026\u201d Dan said, narrowing his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cNice,\u201d Bia said. \u201cNow that these unfounded accusations have been cleared\u2026 We all here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re missing -\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for the cue Ari - WHERE THE FUCK IS LLOYD?!\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cHere!\u201d A voice called as the door swung open again.</p> <p>\u201cOh, speak of the plot convenience!\u201d Rosa rolled her eyes.</p> <p>Lloyd rushed in, dropping a pair of extradimensional bags on the ground before quickly straightening up.</p> <p>Lloyden was the last person Bia had invited along. His golden hair curled around his face neatly, topped with a red cap. He wore an unnaturally clean jacket that looked to be on the higher end of the quality spectrum. It was unlike him to be the last person to arrive to any given meeting, what with his constant obsession with acting professional. Must have had shitty parents or something, I dunno.</p> <p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d He said profusely. \u201cIt\u2019s simply the pinnacle of disappointment that I\u2019ve delayed the proceedings of this gathering. I make clear my regret in - \u201c</p> <p>Rosa grabbed one of the chairs and slammed it into his chest. It didn\u2019t hurt him - he was a tier seven adventurer like myself, and Rosa had no tier at all. He did, however, stumble back in shock.</p> <p>\u201cCan you all stop causing property damage?\u201d Dan said, though he sounded just as bored as usual.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely so very interesting,\u201d Rosalie said, ignoring her brother. \u201cAlright, thanks for the recap, Golden Boy, but we really didn\u2019t need that much.\u201d She turned to Bia. \u201cWhat\u2019re we doing again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Troltano,\u201d I answered, as her neck snapped around to me instead. \u201cTo hire a higher tier adventuring party to clear out whatever attacked me last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Troltano. That\u2019s in\u2026 what, the south?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. At the border of the Sammemmnon province. You\u2019ve graduated, you must know the local geography.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, relatable!\u201d Bia said.</p> <p>Lloyd settled down on a bar stool next to Ari and pulled out a drinking flask, warily watching the chair he\u2019d been slammed with.</p> <p>\u201cSo!\u201d Bia announced. \u201cDoes everyone have their luggage?\u201d</p> <p>A chorus of assent echoed through the room.</p> <p>\u201cRighto! Off we go then! I have the crabs ready in the lot.\u201d</p> <p>She marched right out the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does she mean by crabs?\u201d Rosa asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo idea, but it\u2019s probably something stupid,\u201d I replied, before following my sister outside.</p>"},{"location":"Story/Mainline%20Story/Advent%20of%20the%20Haelborne/#chapter-iii-crab-rider","title":"Chapter III: Crab Rider","text":"<p>big crab</p> Warning <p>Chapter illustrations currently WIP.</p> <p>\u201cThose are not horses.\u201d</p> <p>Bia had apparently bought a bunch of crabs. Not a van, not a car, not even a horse. Three six foot tall crabs standing in the street outside the inn, each fitted with a saddle.</p> Creature: [Hexacampus] (Crustacean) <p>Average Tier: V</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>A large crab creature, usually four or five feet tall. Its legs make up most of that height, as they are nearly vertical when standing. They shuffle like all crabs, but are able to do so at extreme speed, rivalling that of a traditional motorized vehicle. Because of this, fae use them as mounts, but they are rarely seen due to how hard to tame they are.</p> <p>\u201cBia,\u201d I said, annoyed. \u201cWhy in the seven hells did you buy hexacampi? How bloody expensive was this?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCars and horses are just so default y\u2019know?\u201d She exclaimed, leading one to kneel low enough to step on. \u201cNow, six gigantic ass-kicking megacrabs? Not only is that just really frickin\u2019 sick, this is also a golden opportunity to show off some kooky worldbuilding!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cInteresting statement,\u201d Dan said. He was still standing in the doorway, writing away on his notepad. Not even gigacrabs could shock away his stoicism. Rosa was already next to one of the hexacampi, rapidly flitting around it as she inspected the creature.</p> <p>\u201cI have some\u2026 concerns,\u201d She said. \u201cThe practicality of riding creatures that walk sideways, for example.\u201d</p> <p>Lloyd raised a finger. \u201cFaevinity have been employing hexacampi as mounts since the Miruen Empire. Though not commonly seen in Eorwin \u2013 \u201c</p> <p>\u201cShp-shp-shp,\u201d Bia rolled her eyes. \u201cLloyd, just one sentence is enough. Look: These things are fast \u2013 and definitely sensible in the evolutionary landscape. Not that hard! I could even have cut off that part about the evolutionary landscape, but that adds a nice little tidbit of comedy, which is necessary for unknown reasons.\u201d</p> <p>Bia mounted one of the crabs and tapped its shell, which sent it rocketing off as she grabbed the straps attached to the saddle.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway, I had these for quite a while already. Trained em myself too,\u201d She guided the hexacampus off down the street, past the inn\u2019s garden and then circled back around.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s fuckin\u2019 sick,\u201d Rosa exclaimed, eyes wide.</p> <p>\u201cI know right?!\u201d Bia exclaimed back.</p> <p>\u201cI could run faster than one of those,\u201d I scoffed, rolling my eyes. \u201cDan?\u201d</p> <p>I look up and spot Dan already on a hexacampus as it waddled off at a leisurely pace. He was still writing in the notebook, having ignored our bickering.</p> <p>\u201cShould\u2019ve expected that,\u201d I muttered, then moved towards one of the crabs. It snapped a pincer at me, so I conjured a knife and swiped back.</p> <p>\u201cEasy with the crabs!\u201d Bia called. \u201cThey were actually pretty expensive. But we\u2019re rich! But also, they were expensive.\u201d</p> <p>I glared at her, then the crab. The hexacampus eventually decided to kneel down, so I stepped on \u2013 though still with some difficulty. Four foot tall. Lloyd did the same with his.</p> <p>Rosa hopped right up onto hers, which promptly zoomed off at a speed expected of a tier five creature. It whirled off down the street, Rosa screaming on its back.</p> <p>\u201cBIA! I thought you trained these!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUh, yep, I did,\u201d Bia said shiftily. \u201cJobber must be a bit excited.\u201d</p> <p>I turned to look at her incredulously as Rosa continued.</p> <p>\u201cHow long ago exactly did you buy these?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cA week! I got em from this guy I met at the inn.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to depend on massive crabs that you bought off a random guy in Dan\u2019s inn, which you only trained for a week. Oh yeah, and they\u2019re also the size of a car and have gigantic pincers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRelax! It\u2019s fine. I have a way with animals. I think.\u201d</p> <p>I looked pointedly at the rapidly re-approaching dot that was Rosa and the crab.</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cEhehe. I told him to do that,\u201d Bia whispered to me. I sighed.</p> <p>\u201cRosa!\u201d I called, ignoring Bia\u2019s protests. \u201cYou should tell Bia to fuck off!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy?!\u201d She yelled back.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019ll be funny!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBIA! FUCK YOU!\u201d</p> <p>Eventually, we managed to get \u2018Jobber\u2019 under control, and we set off to leave Javenshard. There wasn\u2019t a lot of luggage, as everything was carried in dimensional bags. I was quite glad to have bought those bags \u2013 absolute lifesavers, I\u2019ll tell ya. Even so, they had taken quite a hunk out of our funds back when Bia and I bought them for the business. In the words of Bia, they were expensive. But also, we\u2019re rich! But also, they\u2019re expensive.</p> <p>We rode out past the inn and towards the town\u2019s walls. Towns here in the north of the Haequar province either built walls or made delicious meals for the monsters. The adventurers here may be able to mitigate that a little, but Javenshard was small enough that everyone pretty much knew everyone. Except for myself, of course. Yes, I had the great privilege of social skills! I just didn\u2019t bother to use them.</p> <p>Anyway, the town was small, so adventurers weren\u2019t very common here. There were only three or four residents besides Bia and myself. Oh, and Lloyd, but he wasn\u2019t local. Based on what I\u2019d seen of their fights, the locals\u2019 skills were\u2026 severely lacking. Even just Bia was an entirely different paradigm compared to them, and that\u2019s saying a lot! To myself, they were children. Little little children, dabbling in the grown-up\u2019s business.</p> <p>Rosalie was fuming with Bia after the incident with \u2018Jobber\u2019. They were still trading increasingly nonsensical insults up ahead. Dan had joined in, not taking sides but simply overanalyzing every word of their conversation. I was sat on a hexacampus, riding next to Lloyd.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you alright?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I said, surprised. \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou look gloomy. Someone kill the cat?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLloyd, what are you on about? Everything\u2019s fine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fine, Ari,\u201d Lloyd said inquisitively. \u201cDidn\u2019t you like\u2026 half die yesterday?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fine. You know the risks, Lloyd, you\u2019re an adventurer too. We half die all the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it doesn\u2019t suck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook, I\u2019m fine,\u201d I gestured, exasperated. \u201cI got stabbed, I healed back up. The stabber was a little weird, but I\u2019m fine. Stop worrying!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOkay, okay. I was just checking. Because, like, Bia\u2019s kind of silly, and Rosa takes after her. And Dan is just weird. They don\u2019t make the best support.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHeh. Bia is very silly,\u201d I looked at the road, cutting through the forest. Bia, Rosa, and Dan were still chattering up ahead. \u201cWell, thanks for giving a shit, but I don\u2019t need it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAri, Ari. Alright, then,\u201d He laughed. \u201cWell, did you get anything valuable out of yesterday\u2019s haul?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know. Wait\u2026 yes! Yeah, Bia looted a crienbeast and got a Governance core. Sick, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally?\u201d Lloyd\u2019s eyes went wide. \u201cI\u2019ve been adventuring two years and I haven\u2019t seen a single one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHell yeah!\u201d I pumped a fist. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably sell it when we get to Evedast. I would have done it this morning, or when we get to Roriodo later, but there aren\u2019t many people with the money nor use for such a thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you do?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m rich. Adventuring pays great when you know what you\u2019re doing. But I\u2019m not much of a ritualist, no. Nor an artificer. I mean, I could probably make something with it \u2013 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWelllllll I wouldn\u2019t say that. I\u2019m just, specialized in other things.\u201d</p> <p>Lloyd chuckled. \u201cRight. Such as?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cKilling, and more killing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow diverse. I can at least do artifice.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut I can do that too!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, really? What\u2019s the best thing you\u2019ve made?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUm, I don\u2019t know,\u201d I shrugged. \u201cLemme look through my bag.\u201d</p> <p>I swung the dimensional backpack onto my lap, reaching my arm in. Most high quality dimensional bags had a function that gave users an instinctual sense of whatever was inside. No idea how it worked - I\u2019m not a ritualist. It was probably some sort of instrument that interfaced with the user\u2019s aura (/Presence but we only use that for the spooky dramatic weirdos). Actually, why am I considering this when these things can fit a whole ass banquet table into a space the size of a fist?</p> <p>Whatever. Anyway, I searched the bag for something cool. I\u2019d seen Lloyd\u2019s work \u2013 he made lots of magic items. Magic darts, potion belts, even some cool little knives I\u2019d seen him engraving ritual circles onto. I\u2019d have to match his standard.</p> <p>I shuffled through the various objects. A potion, another potion, and a lot more potions. I hadn\u2019t really made anything except potions. Then I sensed it \u2013 the puppet.</p> <p>It was a white rabbit puppet, with no eyes, a massive open mouth, and a bow tie.</p> Item: [Rabbit Puppet] (Puppet) <p>Tier: 0</p> <p>Made by: Aryon Hastor</p> <p>I don\u2019t fucking know it\u2019s a rabbit puppet.</p> <p>I didn\u2019t remember making it, but it had my name on it. The Governance didn\u2019t lie \u2013 I must\u2019ve forgotten it. The puppet was simple, but it was also very high quality. It would do.</p> <p>\u201cAha!\u201d I said triumphantly, pulling the puppet out and dangling it from my finger.</p> <p>\u201cIs that\u2026 a rabbit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea, but it has my name on it and it looks cool.\u201d</p> <p>I handed him the puppet, and he turned it over, inspecting it.</p> <p>\u201cWell, it\u2019s not half bad.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cCorrect.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s fully bad.\u201d</p> <p>I shot him a flat look.</p> <p>The crabs moved efficiently under Bia\u2019s direction \u2013 a miracle, as Bia never did anything efficiently. After three hours of tireless riding, the walls of Roriodo came into view. Grand stone walls - which were, in reality, frauds! You think these poor, low tier villages could be even that capable? Nah, all of these are just metre thick walls with fear rituals in them. If a monster wanted in, they got in. They were just deterred from wanting it.</p> <p>We passed through the gates, which had extra rituals on them cos they were extra flimsy. Inside, Roriodo was much like Javenshard. Settlements here often grew into series of rings, as a function of the Governance. The Governance made a point of infiltrating each and every aspect of fae life, and the building of settlements was just one of the many areas it helped facilitate.</p> <p>I\u2019d only been here once before, having crossed through it when Bia and I originally came to Javenshard years ago. The monsters were marginally higher rank back north, so I saw no point backtracking. Bia, however, did.</p> <p>\u201cAfternoon, Dahr!\u201d Bia called from the back of her hexacampus as we passed by a man with a straw hat. He was digging through a coat with so many pockets it was more negative space than matter.</p> <p>\u201cBia! Good to see ya,\u201d Dahr raised a fishing pole from the rack next to him in greeting. \u201cI see ye got yer dirty rich hands on a crabbo. What I wouldn\u2019t give to fish up one of those things! Except, of course, a hefty sum of cash to one.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Bia laughed as we rode away. \u201cHope your next catch goes good!\u201d</p> <p>Dahr raised a hand in farewell, then returned to digging through his coat.</p> <p>I steered my hexacampus towards Bia\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cYou know this guy?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, I know everyone here,\u201d she replied.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone,\u201d I repeated incredulously.</p> <p>\u201cLook, it\u2019s not a bad thing to have a social life. Try it out sometime.\u201d</p> <p>Bia wasn\u2019t lying when she said she knew everyone in Roriodo. I could swear that she greeted literally every civilian we passed by. And I use the term civilian specifically \u2013 there were definitely no adventurers here. Or at least, no adventurer worth paying attention to. I could probably decimate this whole town in a week! With Bia and Lloyd \u2013 fuck it, a day, tops. Adventurers as skilled as us are super rare \u2018round the northen end of Haelcrien. </p> <p>Eventually, Bia brought us to the stables that she used when she\u2019d come around Roriodo in the past (she rented a horse sometimes). They didn\u2019t usually receive hexacampi, but Bia\u2019s bullshitting, charisma, and mysterious goodwill with Roriodoans convinced em to deal with our rides. With those taken care of, we started looking for somewhere to stay the night.</p> <p>\u201cSo, what\u2019s it like here in these other northern towns?\u201d Rosa asked me giddily.</p> <p>\u201cAsk Bia instead,\u201d Dan said in his usual I-am-very-bored-and-therefore-cool tone. \u201cAri doesn\u2019t leave Javenshard. She has no social life.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy does everyone keep saying that?\u201d I spun around, braid twirling.</p> <p>\u201cBecause it\u2019s true?\u201d chimed Lloyd.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s one know-it-all comment I can stomach!\u201d Rosa said. Lloyd pumped his fist. \u201cOkay, Ari, you\u2019re boring.\u201d She zipped to Bia\u2019s side with speed that didn\u2019t befit a tierless fae.</p> <p>\u201cSo, Bia, what\u2019s it like in the other northern towns?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, it\u2019s fucking weird,\u201d Bia said. \u201cAnd I like it that way. These non-Ari, happy and fun civilian types are really quite pleasant to be around and do indeed have a social life\u2026\u201d</p> <p>I shook my head and walked along, panning my eyes over the street. The town was composed mostly from stone-walled cabins with wooden roofs, as was standard this far north and this far from true civilization. A rare few metal-scaffolding buildings were scattered around the town\u2019s central square, but other than that, it was quite quaint.</p> <p>\u201cOhhh yeah!\u201d Bia spouted suddenly. \u201cRosa, Dan. We should get you some adventuring gear.\u201d</p> <p>Dan shrugged.</p> <p>\u201cOoooh yes,\u201d Rosa answered with matching enthusiasm. \u201cDefinitely. Must have. Fighting monsters? Cool as all hells.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh come on,\u201d I said. \u201cWe can\u2019t get you shit here. Roridio is not an adventuring town and I will not have my idiots going around in discount gear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d came Bia. \u201cI know a guy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou seem to know a lot of people here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a social \u2014\u201c</p> <p>***</p> <p>Bia guided us to a box that was the picture of theatrically pretentious impure hermetic-cabin-in-the-woods-ness. Logs were stacked atop one another for the logs \u2014 but it was blatantly just a facade over some smooth and insulated wood and metal. The other, more obvious facade was the sloped roof, which was in fact just a flat decorative piece stood up on the roof of the building. It was like the building was trying harder to look fake than to actually hide behind its various pretenses.</p> <p>What I mean to say is, it looked suspicious as hell.</p> <p>Bia proceeded to barge her way in like an overconfident protagonist blissfully unaware of their various financial deficits. The wooded plank doors declined. I marched up next to her and pushed the doors to either side. They were sliding doors \u2014 I know my shady businesses.</p> <p>\u201cOh bloody hells,\u201d Bia muttered as I continued in. \u201cReally?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHaven\u2019t you been here before?\u201d Lloyd asked her.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, but Noka keeps changing shit up. Marketing maybe. Why in Ayueso\u2019s name does anyone use sliding doors?! They\u2019re so goddamned inelegant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAyueso would not like scum uttering her name, I\u2019d wager,\u201d I drawled in monotone, walking up to a bench placed at the side of the room. I sat down and gazed expectantly at the door like a disappointed mother. \u201cAlso, the Trinity doesn\u2019t exist. Basic firmament theory proved that two decades ago and we\u2019re still dealing with damned Stagnants.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou say hells all the time,\u201d Bia complained.</p> <p>\u201cThe hells are cool, and \u2014 \u201c</p> <p>\u201cWell actually, they\u2019re a purely metaphysical space in which heat does not exist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d</p> <p>The other three filed in as Bia walked up to the counter and rang a bell. We waited awkwardly until a tall woman in a discount sorceress outfit stumbled into view.</p> <p>\u201cBia!\u201d she said in cheerful greeting, trying too hard to fake an old woman\u2019s voice.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Noka,\u201d Bia replied in the squeakiest tone she could muster. \u201cHave you any burgers?\u201d</p> <p>They both burst out laughing.</p> <p>\u201cYou do realize making inside jokes in front of people who don\u2019t know them just makes you look crazy?\u201d I asked.</p> <p>\u201cI am crazy!\u201d Bia replied with a giggle.</p> <p>\u201cFor burgers,\u201d Noka added delightfully.</p> <p>\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d I sighed, pushing Bia away as she fell into a laughing fit. \u201cMorning \u2013 Noka, was it? We\u2019re here to get a pair of zeroes some adventuring gear. Loath as I am to believe in anything Bia recommends, the adventuring industry here sucks ass and you\u2019re the only place we could find. As team leader \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Rosa interjected. \u201cWhoever said \u2013 \u201c</p> <p>\u201cMe. We wouldn\u2019t be out here if I hadn\u2019t gotten mauled by a malicious fleshy cheese grater. As team leader \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs team leader,\u201d Bia cut in joyously. \u201cMy job is to ensure my people\u2019s safety \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd I demand a sample of your wares,\u201d I cut back in, glaring at Bia. She had an odd ability to predict exactly what someone was about to say. Lloyd laughed.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I assure you my wares are perfectly up to standard,\u201d Noka said, leaning over the desk with a leering grin. I stared back with half-lids.</p> <p>She unlocked the gate into the backroom and stepped in with a waving gesture. We followed through the door into a storage room the size of a walk-in closet. There was no equipment here; just piles of leather that I guessed to be dimensional bags. Noka poised to begin looking for something \u2013 then turned back around.</p> <p>\u201cSay, what archetype you going for?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSay what?\u201d Rosa asked.</p> <p>\u201cShe means,\u201d I answered. \u201cIf you want to be a mage or warrior or seven foot tall globular mass or whatever the fuck.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s the coolest one?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMe. High skill high damage and zero margin of error.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cScout archetypes are pretty fun too,\u201d Lloyd said.</p> <p>\u201cLloyd, you\u2019ve only ever tried that archetype.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd you \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy adventuring journey was a long succession of formulative experiences of emotional depth \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFuck you Ari, you\u2019re boring,\u201d Bia jumped in. \u201cAs a support spellcaster with suspiciously offensive blood powers, I can assure you that my specialization \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHas a cool factor based entirely off eye candy and zero effectiveness.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBullshit!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook Bia, you barely ever contribute \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHi,\u201d said Rosa, holding up a green cloak and some light-looking fabric garments, lined with silver decor. \u201cCan y\u2019all shut up? I picked something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLet me inspect it,\u201d Bia said.</p> <p>\u201cNo NO, you have no expertise in this field. I literally had to buy you your own gear because you went to the wrong goddamn side of the city and instead of heading back got drunk in some shitstand bar all fucking day at twelve fucking noon \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWoah, woah, woah!\u201d Bia exclaimed, arms wide. \u201cI have, no IDEA! what you are talking about!\u201d</p> <p>Dan wheezed in the background.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll have to tell us that story sometime,\u201d Lloyd grinned.</p> <p>\u201cWhatev,\u201d I reached out for the green garment and gave it a tap.</p> Item: [Huntsman Set No. 12] (Outfit) <p>Tier: 0</p> <p>Made by: Noka Aquiesce</p> <p>Another hunter\u2019s garb.

Which turns out to be a lot more than I expected on account of her having a social life.\u201d</p> <p>This comment prompted narrowed eyes to Bia. She smiled innocently.</p> <p>\u201cValid lifestyle then,\u201d I approved, then turned to Rosalith. \u201cArchery, aye? I recall your aim was never the best w hen we played warball.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPractice makes perfect!\u201d she replied matter-of-factly.</p> <p>\u201cProcrastination makes perfect,\u201d Bia said.</p> <p>\u201cPerfection is a fictional construct, \u201d said Lloyd.</p> <p>\u201cPhilosophers thou art not,\u201d I sighed. \u201cRosa, I\u2019m assuming you actually have the money for this.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh wait, money exists,\u201d Rosa said in tongue of poor. \u201cNoka, how much?\u201d</p> <p>Suffice to say she blanched at the number.</p> <p>\u201cAnd Dan \u2013 \u201d</p> <p>\u201cWay ahead of you mate,\u201d Dan stuffed an armoured-something into a dimensional bag. Two blades with inset green gems lay against the wall next to him.</p> <p>\u201cHow the hell did you \u2013\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDid you four not notice that I contributed zero dialogue to your threeway pissing contest? Rosa, I\u2019ll cover your costs. You\u2019re making dinner for a week the next we get back though.\u201d</p> <p>Rosa raised a finger, then put it down with a sigh.</p> <p>***</p> <p>We found a place to stay the night \u2013 which wasn\u2019t very hard with how many times Bia\u2019s been here. She\u2019s probably got a bajillion discounts on every hotel in the town, little freak.</p> <p>Dinner\u2019s been had and I\u2019m not describing the chaotic mess that was \u2013 the others are still down there screaming at each other. I\u2019m up in mine and Bia\u2019s room painting, pulling from memory. Tier seven lets me do that without getting a headache.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d Lloyd says from the couch, putting down his book. \u201cWhere else are we stopping before Troltano?\u201d</p> <p>I put down another brushstroke against a tall alpine trunk.</p> <p>\u201cAnother little town called Evedast. I think that\u2019s about it. Can\u2019t wait to get out of here so Bia can stop obnoxiously knowing every single little thing about \u2013 everything.\u201d</p> <p>Lloyd laughed.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, she\u2019s real annoying sometimes. Funny though.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNever admit that in my company, Lloyd.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course.\u201d</p> <p>\u2026</p> <p>I turned back to the painting and crossed shadows across the sky.</p> <p>\u201cSo what\u2019re ya painting?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJaven Woods.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you paint anything else?\u201d</p> <p>Now that I think of it, not really.</p> <p>\u201cI painted the street some times.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat about, people?\u201d </p> <p>I cocked an eyebrow. A dark silhouette appears left-bottom canvas.</p> <p>\u201cNot often, and always from the back. People are weird. Good to sketch, but I don\u2019t like painting them. Too many planes on the face. Weird topography and I can never get it right.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI see. Maybe try that sometime?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd who would I paint?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople you spend a lot of time with, I\u2019d guess. Or yourself, that\u2019d look pretty good.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not putting up a painting of myself on my bedroom wall. It would look narcissistic.\u201d</p> <p>I glared a splotch on the canvas that would not look right whichever way I painted over it.</p> <p>\u201cArtists make self-portraits all the time.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd where\u2019d ya hear that? You took art in school?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo no, I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cActually, where did you learn to fight?\u201d I asked, now aggressively stabbing the paint blob. \u201cIt certainly wasn\u2019t in these backwaters.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMy family actually comes from the Delirian Isles. We\u2019re scholars, by tradition, but I wanted something a little different. I had a\u2026 falling out with them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened?\u201d I inquired.</p> <p>\u201cThey didn\u2019t like where my life was going,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cAssholes. I still keep in touch with my cousin Ramuj though. He\u2019s a cool guy. Does work for the Eden Repository in Edenthein.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNice,\u201d I said, having run out of things to discuss. Holding a conversation was not one of my best skills.</p> <p>There was silence for a while. I seethed one last time at that splotch before starting to take down the easel.</p> <p>\u201cI should probably go to sleep now,\u201d I said. \u201cTier seven or not, rest is important \u2013 they always drove that home back in the big city.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBig city?\u201d Lloyd asked.</p> <p>\u201cWhere we immigrated from. Parents never bothered telling me and I took enough of a hint not to ask.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOdd.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep now. You should probably go too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, okay. See you tomorrow, yeah?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo shit, where else would we be?\u201d</p> Warning <p>Next chapter is WIP.</p>"},{"location":"Story/Short%20Stories/","title":"Short Stories","text":"<p>These stories are not locked to the main plot and serve to flesh out other elements of the world or simply random ideas I.

The Amirlithic army had lined up a contigent of ships in voidspace, observing the anomalous object - though most of the soldiers had correctly interpreted \u2018observe\u2019 as \u2018destroy\u2019. They had all been waiting for a starter\u2019s pistol that was either several hours late or not there at all. Keppelky had joined up with the expedition for action, not loitering around next to some random cube in the Void.</p> <p>The cube in question was at least somewhat interesting. Keppelky had been staring at it for most of the intervening time. The ship\u2019s sensors visualized it as a titanic object some one and a half million kilometres wide, made from an unknown metal. It drifted slowly through the metaphysical space of the Void, doing absolutely nothing. Yet of course, Amirlithic higher-ups had decided it had to be monitored.</p> <p>Just as Keppelky was considering turning around and returning to Seronveth Base, the cube on the screen shook. His eyes rapidly snapped towards the dashboard, hands flying across the panels and into ready position. He felt the ship\u2019s subtle vibration as his senses flowed into that combative zen.</p> <p>\u201cAll ships on alert!\u201d blared the General through the communications system. Thankfully, the message could travel with haste through the small metaphysical distance between the ships.</p> <p>Eyes glued to the screen, Keppelky watched as the cube\u2019s vibration stopped and a panel on it\u2019s surface retracted, revealing a pulsing blue glow.</p> <p>Each ship in the fleet also began emitting a matching light, that of a standard energy shield used on dimensional ships. From within the cube, another smaller cube emerged, bathed in the light of the energy shield. The new cube, presumably some form of dimensional vessel, stopped just away from the previous cube and exited the cube\u2019s reality. The fleet collectively swapped their displays to visualize the new proto-reality generated around the ship.</p> <p>A crackling noise spawned from the comms panel, and a new voice splintered out of it.</p> <p>\u201cGood day, Agbe-lit - nope - Amberlith-ik soldiers. I, am David Kim.\u201d</p> <p>Keppelky looked at the panel in confusion. Had the cube ship\u2026 hacked into the comms network?</p> <p>Amirlithic technology was state of the art, premium quality, military grade. Only the Architect faction surpassed them. What could possibly breach their systems?</p> <p>\u201cDavid Kim,\u201d the General\u2019s voice echoed, as Keppelky turned back to the display screen. \u201cI am going to need you and your little cube to pack up and- \u201c</p> <p>\u201cDO NOT INSULT THE COOB.\u201d</p> <p>The voice of David Kim blared out like the decree of an Immortal, seeming to transcend the dimensional barriers between the ships and rattle their hulls regardless of the petty laws of metaphysics. Keppelky heard the pipes in the hull shake as volatile aura fuel slurry sprang about in nonsensical patterns, as if stampeding away from the sound. The panels and displays of the cockpit flickered unstably.</p> <p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Kim\u2019s voice reasserted itself. \u201cI am David Kim of the new corporate empire of idi0cy\u2024inc. I am here for assurances.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou - son of a - can\u2019t - \u201d the General attempted to get a few words in, but Kim seemed to have acquired priority.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I most certainly can. No profanity please, the Narrator is submitting this one to a school assignment.\u201d</p> <p>His words hung in the air. School assignment? Narrator? Keppelky thought in confusion. Whatever idi0cy\u2024inc was, they had not sent a very good negotiator. Leaning forward over the control panel, Keppelky\u2019s fingers tensed over the dials and buttons.</p> <p>\u201cAllow me to clarify. I am here to give assurances, not to get them. The Coob and the surrounding voidspace has become the territory of idi0cy\u2024inc. Attempt to revert this, and you shall suffer the wrath of the Narrator. Which you may receive regardless, as it would be funny.\u201d</p> <p>Unable to receive orders from the General, the fleet was growing increasingly tense. The tension was broken when the ship sensors detected an Amirlithic projectile transcending dimensional barriers and speeding towards the cube ship.  It hit the shield, which rippled and settled back into place. Keppelky winced, knowing that the perpetrator would likely be reprimanded.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Kim drawled. \u201cYou all have thirty seconds to vacate the area before the Coob blasts you to smithereens.\u201d</p> <p>None of the ships moved, until an aura blasted out from the Coob. The power within was indescribable, seeming to transcend the Void itself. Keppelky seemed to have awakened a new sense altogether as the aura shredded at his soul. His hands flashed across the control panel in natural instinct to turn the ship right around as countless of the fleet followed, fleeing from the almighty Coob, attempting to block out the sounds and sights and smells flashbanging his senses.</p> <p>He ran and ran and ran, until the rest of the fleet was no longer in comm vicinity and the Coob was long gone. He would be content to rest there in the endless Void for the rest of his days, as long as he would never see the Coob again.</p>"},{"location":"Story/Short%20Stories/Krath%27s%20Interview/","title":"Krath's Interview","text":"Info <p>For reference on what these symbols mean, see the story index</p>"},{"location":"Story/Short%20Stories/Krath%27s%20Interview/#preface","title":"Preface","text":"<p>This short story was written by my friend idiocy\u2024inc, who has contributed many ideas to the world of COA including kickstarting most of the bullshit with the fourth wall.

He turned around in his rolling chair, sat twiddling his thumbs anxiously on the polished brown desk. The numerous pieces of paperwork scattered across the desk were illuminated from the neon cyan-like colour emanating from a screen hovering on the desk. Aside from the cat memes and eons of TOS agreements on the screen, a pop up window sat at the very front layer of the screen. Across the screen sprawled in English, wrote the words \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like to initiate the interview process?\u201d There were four buttons on the screen, the rest in the 4<sup>th</sup> dimension, bouncing around and phasing into each other. They read yes, no, yea, nah, sure, no yeah, yeah no, yay, all of the above, none of the below, 5 random options, one month subscription to crunchyroll, and a button for activating a 3 time use prayer account for 20 bucks.</p> <p>Krath furrowed his eyebrows in a slight confusion at the prompts flying across the screen. Of course, he had trained for situations like this. \u201cI\u2019ve used the interconnection cube before, this is no big issue.\u201d He thought, before starting to eliminate the wrong answers. Crunchyroll was clearly a scam. He wouldn\u2019t be paying any megachurch pastors anytime soon. Yes could be interpreted wrong, same as for no, and both yea and nah were discontinued after the 1324 incident. All of the above was clearly a conspiracy started by the Jarnu tech company, 5 random options was too uncertain, so that only left none of the below left. With a confident smirk on his face, Krath locked onto the button and gave it a press.</p> <p>\u201cUser response received. We will take that as a no.\u201d The screen replied in a cold robotic voice, as Krath set his elbow on the table, pinched his nose bridge and took a deep breath.</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Krath said, his smirk evaporating faster than his bank account.</p> <p>Krath bought another screen, using up the last of his dwindling funds. He knew that his only escape from his dire situation was to go somewhere where his debt was abolished, and somewhere where no one had any jurisdiction over him. Taking the plunge, he opened up the screen again. He got through all the distracting pop ups and scams in the way, and got back to the screen. It was written in Spanish.</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p> <p>Krath overdrew his credit card, activating another screen. He had a translator with him, so that he wouldn\u2019t get screwed over by Spanish options again. He clicked all of the above.</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p> <p>Krath clicked yea.</p> <p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>Krath clicked, no, and then yes, and then no yeah, and all the options with variations of no and yes.</p> <p>\u201cPiece of sh-\u201d</p> <p>Krath failed a quicktime event before getting to the screen.</p> <p>\u201cMotherfu-\u201d</p> <p>Krath got a one month crunchyroll subscription.</p> <p>\u201cThis anime sucks a-\u201d</p> <p>Krath read the fine print.</p> <p>\u201cOh what the f- There is a\u2026one in \u2026 27 chance your interview will be accepted upon hitting the 5 r- sigh, shiiiiiii-\u201d</p> <p>Krath now owes more money than is currently in circulation, and then the interview finally started. Krath had a relieved, but also absolutely infuriated look on his face. His desk was practically broken in half, his room in complete disarray. A countdown timer started on the screen, starting from five and ticking down by one every second. As the display struck zero, Krath felt everything possible for a split second, before being transported into a room where he could barely fit. The walls were of a seamless chrome texture. Light seemingly coming from nowhere bounced off the walls. It was almost hard to look at, the strange arrays of light taking a toll on Krath\u2019s sight. There was a small window, placed in a way that made the room seem like solitary confinement. On the window was a coloured pencil drawing of a meadow, with a sun and clouds and a really weird animal that Krath couldn\u2019t make sense of.</p> <p>The box made a loud whirring noise, light bleeding through the paper blocking the window. The box around him unfolded out of existence leaving behind the drawing, and opened into what looked like an interrogation room. The walls were grey, looking like they were built out of aluminum sheets. On one side of the room was a window with writing on it on the other side, reading \u201cNTE: fix the one sided mirror, it's on the wrong side :(.\u201d It was strange, with words being misspelled and barely intelligible through the shotty handwriting. There were also a couple of people on the other side of the window. Krath turned his attention to the woman seated down at the other side of the table, who motioned for him to sit down.</p> <p>Krath took his seat. The chair was completely flat and made of metal, which was incredibly uncomfortable to sit in. The woman on the other side of the table was very clearly tired, struggling to keep his eyes open. Despite this, she was staring rather intensely at Krath. Both of them sat there for what felt like hours. Each passing second Krath was feeling more and more unease. Thankfully, the woman at the other side of the table was first to break the silence, turning around at the window before doing so.</p> <p>\u201cWhen do I start the interview? I have been waiting here for about 15 minutes.\u201d The woman said in a clearly frustrated voice towards the two people in the other room.</p> <p>\u201cWait, the guy is here already?\u201d One of the employees said, pausing his game of chess with the other employee.</p> <p>\u201cYes. You know when I started going here as an intern I thought I would be doing some sick ass science shit, and this is a real downgrade.\u201d The intern said back to the people in the window.</p> <p>\u201cHey hey hey, we told you that we can\u2019t see through this mirror because it's on the wrong side, okay?\u201d The other employee said.</p> <p>Krath sat as the three argued about what was going on. There were a lot of insults thrown, a lot of threats of firing, and a lot of incompetency. After a little while, they were finally able to get things going.</p> <p>\u201cAlrighty, time for one of the hardest brain teasers we have ever come up with. How many parallel sides does a cube have?\u201d The woman said, in a sort of relieved voice.</p> <p>\u201cAha! Trick question! -4!\u201d Krath said in an energetic voice like he had just out played the system.</p> <p>\u201cIt's three.\u201d The interviewer says in a monotone voice.</p> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d Krath says, before slouching back into his chair as an awkward silence struck the room.</p> <p>\u201cMoving on. Wh-\u201d The intern says before being cut off by the speaker system.</p> <p>\u201cHey uhh, Krath, do you know if you could find me a mate in 3 from this position? It's my turn right now.\u201d One of the employees asked, while holding up a magnetic chessboard to the window.</p> <p>\u201cOh uhhh, see that there horse?\u201d Krath said, pointing vaguely in that direction.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t see through the mirror.\u201d The employee responded through the speaker.</p> <p>\u201cAh, right. The white one on the black square, just shank it with that bishop, and that's a discovered check. And I think you can see where this is, yknow,\u201d Krath said, stuttering slightly at the unexpected prompt.</p> <p>\u201cYea, the queen is in prime position. Try kicking my ass now Jared.\u201d The employee said, pulling the chess board back and playing the moves.</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t get paid enough for this.\u201d Said the other employee in a way that suggests this has happened before.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yea, and intern dude. You can let the guy pass, he has my approval.\u201d</p> <p>With a disappointed look on her face, the intern raises his hand. Suddenly, a non-euclidean horror begins to manifest 2 centimeters away from her palm. The intern starts to slowly chant something, while incantations, dodecahedrons, penrose triangles and most importantly bullshit starts to gather. The shadowy form of a remote can be seen, and soon the disruption in physics and metaphysics collapses into a fully formed remote. Krath is bewildered, while the intern has an incredibly stern expression on her face. The intern then presses the button on the remote.</p> <p>\u201cAlrighty, you can go to the next room.\u201d The intern says not looking at where the door should be.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2026 exactly?\u201d Krath asks</p> <p>\u201cOh fu- did it not wo- the intern looks around her-yeah, no it didn\u2019t. I swear I kept a fresh pack of double A\u2019s on me, batteries not included my ass.\u201d The intern says, fumbling around her coat pockets presumably trying to find double A batteries.</p> <p>\u201cAha! There it fucking is. Let's go. Now how the hell do these fit? Ah. there\u2026 Really? Nothing? God, they write these symbols like madmen.\u201d The intern said while fiddling with the battery alignment.</p> <p>\u201cI think those need to go diagonally across each other.\u201d Krath said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not. They wouldn\u2019t design this bullshit to become a parralelogr- oh wait. That kinda makes sense. Is this why I don\u2019t get paid?\u201d The intern says before clicking the button.</p> <p>This time a door opens out of the wall, and Krath walks through it. He pauses slightly, about to say something, but disregards it as everyone in the room seems to have occupied themselves by now. The door opens to an endless open white void, with the frame repeating through it with a gleam like its bad CGI. Without further ado, Krath took a step in. Krath suddenly felt a zooming sensation, before being transported to an endless black void. The only thing he could see was the floor, a slightly gleaming plane that propagated till what seemed to be infinity. The only thing visible now was a man of tall stature in a tuxedo that was definitely of higher quality than Krath\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cHello there my dear lost traveler! Welcome to the void, where your dreams die and your nightmares feed off of the corpses. I am your host, Baruch, and I will be guiding you through eternity in nothing.\u201d The well dressed man says in a shrill game show-like voice that rips through the empty atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a bloody TREE(3) since I met another visitor. So let me guide you through this illogical hellscape!\u201d The man says, voice cascading through nothing like thunder as non-euclidean geometry flocks throughout the world, accompanied by epic music.</p> <p>\u201cNow, care to give an intro-\u201d The man says while turning around. \u201c-Oh fuck its one of you people.\u201d He says, fingers pinching his nose bridge, clearly frustrated as the non-euclidean wonders and epic music slouched back like a sad dog.</p> <p>\u201cIs t-this, not, the interview?\u201d Krath says as the music turns off.</p> <p>\u201cNo. It isn\u2019t. You\u2019re in the wrong cosmology you idiot. Y\u2019know, in my dimension, I am the coolest fucking guy, I\u2019m like a god. I am the host of the void, which isn\u2019t original, but it sure is fucking, cool. Do you know how catchy that song was? And how much better my suit is in comparison to yours? But god ever since you idiot whatevers started showing up I just turn into a gag character.\u201d The man says, clearly very frustrated.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, I guess?\u201d Krath replies, not really sure of what to make of the situation.</p> <p>\u201cYou better be. I spent an eternity making these cool non-euclidean polygon architectures for the next visitor, and now it seems lame as shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is some pretty cool geometry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI, know. So please get out, and go tell those fuckers to quit messing, with a superior, storyline.\u201d</p> <p>Baruch walked up to Krath, and slapped him so hard he got sent to another interview room. His head still moved in the way one would expect after being slapped, and he held his hand against the part of his head that made contact. This time the room seemed more friendly, with a table, rolling chair and a whiteboard on one of the walls. There was an interviewer with a buttoned up shirt that was only half tucked in next to the table, pacing around, before noticing his entrance and greeting him.</p> <p>\u201cHey there!\u201d He said in an enthusiastic tone.</p> <p>\u201cGreetings.\u201d Krath said back, shaking his hand.</p> <p>\u201cSalutations my good sir-\u201d The interviewer said, mocking him. \u201cAnyways, you met the void edgelord guy right? The one called barbados or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Baruch. He was pretty pissed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes-\u201d The interviewer said, pumping his fist. \u201cYou can take a seat, and this whole interview is sort of just a formality. No need to worry at all. First question, who is our lord and savior?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe concept of a cube?\u201d Krath said, kind of expecting it.</p> <p>\u201cHell yeah! This narrator is obsessed with those things. Can\u2019t really express it anywhere else without it being a plot hole so, he has to make it our whole thing, which I am a-okay with. Checkmark there. Now onto question two. Who do you like?\u201d The interviewer said, leaning in, putting more intensity into the atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cWh-what do you mean by like? I am literally new to the office, so I guess no one\u2026?\u201d Krath said, incredibly confused by the line of questioning from the interview.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever sounds believable, I\u2019ll note that down. I like the options you're giving me for office gossip. Alrighty, moving on. What is the answer to the universe, life, narrative plane, and everything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt's definitely 42.\u201d Krath said confidently.</p> <p>\u201cWelp. That\u2019s all I need to know, it's not like they keep me here for quality control.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Isn\u2019t that the purpose of an interview?\u201d Krath said, puzzled.</p> <p>\u201cNope. The purpose is so that I can get paid extra!\u201d The employee said back at him like the answer should be obvious.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do I go now?\u201d Krath asked.</p> <p>\u201cDown the hall, on the door to the left that says ethics committee evaluation office.\u201d The employee said casually while rolling around on his chair.</p> <p>\u201cYou guys actually have a place for ethics.\u201d Krath asked in a slightly surprised tone.</p> <p>\u201cSurprisingly, yes. How much do they actually do? Let me ask you a question. How many ethics committee members does it take to screw in a lightbulb?\u201d The interviewer said, no longer rolling around in his chair and pointing his pen in the direction of Krath inquisitively.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. One? Half a step ladder?\u201d Krath said back.</p> <p>\u201cNone! The ethics committee can\u2019t change anything!\u201d The employee said, laughing hysterically afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cHahaha, well uhh, I\u2019ll be on my way now.\u201d Krath said, trying to laugh along with the employee before walking out the door.</p> <p>As he stepped through the frame, he braced for impact, squinting his eyes. He felt nothing. As he opened his eyes, he realized that it was a normal door. Upon further inspection, he noticed that there wasn\u2019t a door in the frame at all, and that it was in queue for another door. As he scanned the hall, it seemed to be an endless expanse with doors on both sides of the hallway. Some of the doors were open, presumably waiting for a door to become available, and he could peer through them. Through the hall he could see jail complexes, voids, warehouses, all not seeming to fit the geometry of the hallway. As he looked to the left, he found the ethics committee evaluation office. As Krath put his hand on the knob the door disappeared, queuing for another one. In the office there was a roundtable with a woman sitting there.</p> <p>\u201cHello there Krath, take a seat.\u201d The woman said in an ominous voice, as the roundtable was dimly lit.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Krath said as he pulled out the chair and sat on it.</p> <p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have a last name? It's fine. The narrator writing this hardly gave me a first name. However, that is besides the point. Do you know how much outreach this committee has?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to be disrespectful, but given the work conditions, I would assume none.\u201d Krath replied, trying not to come off as disrespectful.</p> <p>\u201cThat is what most people think, there are also a lot of jokes about it. How many ethics committee members does it take to screw in a lightbulb?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone? I'm guessing the punchline is that the ethics committee can\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe guy with the half tucked in shirt told you that one already now didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe definitely did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. Anyways, we do a lot of work to give the impression that we are useless here. However, we are the secret power in this company. You see, our outreach is secretle-\u201d The woman said until the lights turned on. \u201c-God did you turn on the lights? I was trying to be all mysterious and cool okay. We almost had him too, weren\u2019t you the one who wanted someone else to play UNO with us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook here, unnamed friend, if it wasn\u2019t the lights that broke the vibe it would have been my unending laughter. Seeing you trying to convince that intern that we actually do things in here while blatantly copying the ethics committee orientation from the SCP wiki is just sad.\u201d Another woman said, presumably the one who turned on the lights.</p> <p>\u201cWait, what do you guys actually do?\u201d Krath said, more confused now.</p> <p>\u201cWe just get to see whatever projects are happening in our branch and approve them. Last time,  we approved for someone who vaporized a dimension to find his missing sock. Billions dead, likely including the sock because he never found it.\u201d The woman sat at the table said.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. How do I pass this interview, because right now that is really all I care about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really do anything. We\u2019ve been scanning your brain and we\u2019re gonna watch a movie of it together and judge your life decisions for like, ethics and all that. In fact we already have. That's what the weird box you were put in was for. How did you manage to go broke buying stocks?\u201d The woman at the counter grabbing a cereal box said.</p> <p>\u201cHey, I was buying at the dip okay. Also don\u2019t judge my financial abilities.\u201d Krath said in an aggressively defensive manner.</p> <p>\u201cRiiiiiight. Anyways, the least ethical thing you did was having a major labour complex in your basement, but we have 3 next door so I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s a problem. Approved. You can go to the guy at the top now. You\u2019re gonna have to take the stairs though.\u201d The woman at the table said, as an entrance to a staircase opened up out of the walls.</p> <p>\u201cHow many stairs are there?\u201d Krath asked.</p> <p>\u201c9,223,372,036,854,775,807 steps.\u201d The employee responded.</p> <p>\u201cIs there any faster way up? Y\u2019know, other than climbing the 64 bit integer limit?\u201d Krath asked, trying to be hopeful about his options.</p> <p>\u201cYou could sell me your soul for a shortcut. Here\u2019s the contract, sign here.\u201d The employee at the table says, tapping on an empty signature box.</p> <p>\u201cSure, whatever. At this point I have nothing to lose.\u201d Krath said, while signing the document.</p> <p>\u201cReally? You folded that easily?\u201d The employee asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes really. That\u2019s because I have infused 10 souls into my body, which means you only own 10% equity in my total soul assets. Now what\u2019s the shortcut?\u201d Krath said rather confidently</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that's the first time it's happened. Oh well, anyways. Go through the other door.\u201d The woman said in a casual way, as once another entrance opened up, this time to a much shorter staircase.</p> <p>Despite that, it was still a rather long staircase. Fortunately, the gravity inside of the room had apparently been turned off, allowing for easier travel. Krath jumped as hard as he could, and hit the roof. Trying once again, Krath actually managed to get a working trajectory. The stairs appeared to blur as he was going rather quickly through the hall. Slowly, he could see the door at the end come closer and closer to him. Eventually, he made it to the top, hitting his head against the door in the same place he had hit it in the first attempt. Upon his head coming into contact with the door, it disappeared, letting him fly through. In the room gravity returned, and he fell to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cKrath, is it? Get over here.\u201d A man in a suit said, standing next to a bar stool.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Krath said, making his way to the bar in what seemed to be a mansion.</p> <p>\u201cAll that will be answered. First, what do you know about this company? What do we actually do?\u201d The man said while walking into the bar.</p> <p>\u201cI'm not really sure, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>The man chuckled to himself a bit.</p> <p>\u201cWell, how about another question. You know about pataphysics right?\u201d The man said, Krath nodding to his question.</p> <p>\u201cWell all the theories are true. We are in a narrative stack, and there is a narrator to this universe. On technical terms, we\u2019re a massive narrative anomaly. In more understandable words, we are a massive plot hole, designed specifically for shits and giggles. Hell, this whole interview was a gag. The only reason we are where we are, is because we are favoured by the narrator. Let that sink in for a bit.\u201d He said, grabbing two fancy glasses and a bottle of liquor from the bar.</p> <p>\u201cHow reassuring.\u201d Krath said in a sarcastic voice.</p> <p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t work here to reassure. Anyways, I\u2019m the administrator. I am this company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you mean you own this company?\u201d Krath asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I am quite literally the company itself, I am the reason it is here. My real name is Kayden, and I am literally on the same narrative plane as the narrator. Don\u2019t get confused, I don\u2019t narrate. I\u2019m just some guy who is acquainted with the narrator. Notice how I didn\u2019t say friend there. He\u2019s not familiar with those. Anyways I managed to bullshit this gag into existence, you'd better be thankful. This brings us to what you are going to do. We need to maintain the favor of the narrator, if we get too boring or not fun enough we\u2019re either going to get deleted, or even worse, discontinued.\u201d The administrator had just finished pouring the liquor into the glasses, on the rocks, and started walking back to the seat where he once was.</p> <p>\u201cI have many questions, but I have some strange feeling they aren\u2019t going to get answered.\u201d Krath said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d be right about that. One thing I can answer is that you are hired.\u201d The administrator said, while Krath was sloshing his drink around slightly.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, what do I do?\u201d Krath asked, slightly excited but evidently trying to hide it.</p> <p>\u201cYour lifelong career job will be to find anyone developing or using AI, and stop them. By AI I mean the techbro chatgpt kind, and by stop I will usually mean stab.\u201d The administrator said, grabbing his drink and taking a seat.</p> <p>\u201cWhy exactly?\u201d Krath asked.</p> <p>\u201cWell we wouldn\u2019t want the narrator to think that we support something that could take his future job now would we?\u201d The administrator asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo wonder the interview start button was so damn annoying.\u201d Krath said, making a joke about the state of the company\u2019s infrastructure.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that.\u201d</p> <p>The administrator raised his glass, and Krath followed.</p> <p>\u201cIn the favour of god.\u201d The administrator said.</p> <p>\u201cIn the favour of god.\u201d Krath affirmed.</p> <p>A glass clink can be felt throughout idi0cy\u2024inc voidspace.</p>"},{"location":"Story/Short%20Stories/The%20Great%20Inventor/","title":"The Great Inventor","text":"Info <p>For reference on what these symbols mean, see the story index</p> <p>In the darkness, there was a piece of rock. It was rectangular and flat, and a few thousand kilometres thick. On its surface were thousands of tubelike structures, strung up between cylindrical towers that pushed up against the world\u2019s ceiling. Six-limbed citizens crawled across their surfaces, entering through various arched holes to do their business.</p> <p>Within a cluster of a thousand such towers, there lived the Great Inventor. He was alone in his tower, and nobody bothered him. The man slaved away at his workbench, drawing plans and carving sigils and assembling machines. He\u2019d modified his own body to not require sleep. Every fibre of his life was dedicated to his gray creation.</p> <p>Days pass. The Inventor pulled wires, etched circuits and welded metal. The cacophony echoed through the city\u2019s great towers, like a ghost bashing away at a wall, begging to be heard. The Inventor drags many parts into the chamber: metal, wood, fabric, flesh. His machine grows day by day, soon occupying most of the massive chamber. Its hulking form curled up one wall in ribbons and clumps of material, looming over the Inventor as he hammered against its surface.</p> <p>Finally, after years of toil, the Inventor sits down on an empty wooden crate. He cranes his head up and admires his creation. It stands there, motionless. Two chains hang from within the bowels of the machine, and strung up between them is a faceless automaton. The Inventor stares at the empty body, thinks, grins. He lifts a hand and snaps a bony finger.</p> <p>The machine rumbles.</p> <p>Finally, thinks the Inventor, will all those wrongs be righted. The unjustly slain will walk this land again, and then I will no longer need to fear. All those I watched, bones and husks, will no longer need to fear. There is no longer anything to fear.</p> <p>The Inventor shifts his weight, then stands. Anticipation is wild in his eyes, laser focused on the automaton. And as if in reaction to his gaze, the automaton moves. It jerks, once, twice, falls to the ground. The Inventor cackles with joy!</p> <p>And so be it! exclaims the Inventor. It is done. I have laughed in the face of the Immortals, laughed in the face of death itself, the great tragedy! You are no longer welcome in this world!</p> <p>He was so ecstatic and triumphant, but in reality ignorant. For, he wasn\u2019t the only one cackling.

Recent papers have noted a significant, rather unscientific, \u2018vibe\u2019 of artificiality, which has been cause for minor concern, but only in the scientific community.

Before the Chaos took its role as Raelia Hastor, it decided to play god for a little while, dealing with the mortals of Kaaldenvale in ways that would\u2019ve been taboo had it still been among the Six.  It strengthened Kaaldenvale and hid it from the gaze of the experiments on Kaaldenvale during this period, replicating elements seen in other realities and refining them to its purposes, namely the magic system, which the Chaos chose over any number of other variations for its order and strictures, something that, contrary to what you might think, fascinated more than repelled it.</p> <p>The magic system manifests as the Governance. It bestows itself upon all native inhabitants of Kaaldenvale, and can be accessed by them in the form of floating translucent screens. This is the front of the Governance, using numbers and statistics to organize the intensely chaotic churn of magic within its users. The existence of something so at odds with nature yet seemingly a fundamental part of reality has inspired conspiracy theorists that believe the world is a simulation.</p> <p>The fundamental purpose of the Governance is to aid the locals against any incoming dimensional forces, giving them a fighting chance against anything that would bother coming after the hiding Chaos.</p> <p>The Governance is rooted at a sentient core built on an island in Aunper. Despite the intent of making the Governance artificial, orderly, and perfect, the Chaos could not go against its nature. Below the shiny screens and complex mechanics, the Governance\u2019s sentience allows it to make conscious decisions to aid or deter characters.</p> <p>The magic system is referred to by the denizens of Kaaldenvale by various names, the most common being simply, \u201cthe Governance.\u201d Other names for the Governance include \u201cthe Script,\u201d \u201cthe System,\u201d and other similarly generic LitRPG system names.</p>"},{"location":"Worldbuilding/Realities/Kaaldenvale/Magic%20System/Abilities/","title":"Abilities","text":"<p>fireballs !</p>  Spoiler <p>Article contains spoilers: Full Series</p> <p>Abilities can be attained through manifestations similar to the far rarer concept manifestations.

The primary source of it comes from monsters, which are unnaturally large stores of physically manifested metaphysical energy generated by the Governance. Absorbing experience energy generates an influx of \u2018knowledge\u2019 (analogous to experience points) for the soul to consume and use to permanently upgrade itself on command. Alternatively, non-combat oriented users may buy experience from vendors, but monster-slaying is ultimately the basis of all experience gathering. This is because the easiest way for the Chaos to distribute stable and balanced sources of magic was through monsters.</p> <p>Combat specializations are considered the base of the Governance, creating experience by killing monsters. Next up are farmers and craftsmen, who buy generated experience, level up, and use their bonuses from levelling to multiply the experience they had bought. Further on, a tax on craftsmen and farmer experience is taken and given to the governing specializations, who use it to strengthen the nations, from which a further tax is taken at the end of each year for the Apotheosis.</p> <p>Experience points may be bought and sold, and an individual can extract their experience points on command.

The key difference is that instead of being based upon a profession, these specializations are based on a concept. For example, a specialization concept of \u201cfeast,\u201d could mean a literal feast- the result being a cook of some sort- or a feast of some other thing, such as life force, resulting in some manner of life-leeching combat specialization. Usually, these are far more complex, resulting in specialized roles such as \u2018Balancebringer\u2019 and \u2018Felborn.\u2019</p> <p>The potential to activate a specialization is always inside a Kaalvalese native. This requires a special ritual - the Governance was designed this way to gatekeep power to responsible people, so that four year olds weren\u2019t blowing themselves up on the street. Predictably, this has caused some groups to gatekeep specializations entirely, not allowing people to have coordinated ability sets that made full use of the Governance.</p> <p>The ritual allows the user to pick a base specialization concept that they have previously been exposed to. Elemental concepts such as water are predictably common, and so are various sentience-based concepts like truth and judgement. Harder to come by are things like magic or reality, which indicates a user who spent a lot of time around powerful metaphysical energies.</p> <p>Specializations can be further refined by absorbing manifestations, various objects containing concentrated \u2018concept.\u2019 Manifestations are products of the Governance, created by manipulating ambient aura into solid objects held together with Governance cores. They form in places where there has been an overflow of some concept. Manifestations are more powerful depending on how large an overflow is. For example, the concept \u201cInternecion\u201d could occur during a war of nuclear proportions. \u201cFire\u201d could occur in a burnt down house, while \u201cInferno\u201d could appear down in the deepest depths of a volcano. Absorbing these requires a ritual and is how people attain complex specializations. The Governance allows variation such as this because it recognizes the benefits of versatility. Making all fae uniformly powerful would be detrimental to their future performance.</p> <p>Without a specialization, a user may still level and use other aspects of the Governance. However, their abilities and other aspects will not lean towards a theme or synergize with each other, leading to an overall less efficient power set.</p>"},{"location":"Worldbuilding/Realities/Kaaldenvale/Magic%20System/Titles/","title":"Titles","text":"<p>im not like the other abilities</p>  Incomplete <p>Article is missing information.</p>  Spoiler <p>Article contains spoilers: Full Series</p> <p>Titles are passive abilities that are exceedingly rare.

These can be any shape, seeing as travelling through purely spiritual space doesn\u2019t exactly involve aerodynamics.</p> <p>Dimensional vessel technology works by creating a temporary physical reality for the duration of the trip through the metaphorical \u201cdistance\u201d in the void between worlds. It\u2019s far more stable than any other method of dimensional intrusion. Due to the nature of the Void, to view the Void with mortal eyes is a death sentence. Because of this, dimensional vessels do not have windows. Dimensional vessels typically travel along firmament supports to move between realities, despite their ability to move through empty metaspace. This simplifies navigation due to travelling along established paths. Highly travelled supports are called voidways and often have stationary dimensional vessels as rest stops for those with less luxurious vehicles.</p> <p>Dimensional vessels are sometimes adapted to create pseudo-realities. Interdimensional societies employ these as Void bases. These can often reach titanic sizes, notable instances including the Void cities of the Architects, the universe-sized artificial Amirlith, and the Haelborne's Holy City of Rattesse.</p> <p>Before the invention of dimensional portals and vessels, some older methods were attempted, none of which worked. These include various devices to increase an object\u2019s speed to unnatural levels. Predictably, this was unable to transcend dimensional barriers. Phasing through matter was also attempted, and would occasionally, with the correct conditions, dump the perpetrating matter into the Void, leaving it to be annihilated. This formed the basis of the systems used to launch dimensional vessels. There was also dimensional tunnelling, wherein auramancers used concentrated aura bursts to dig through the dimensional barrier. This caused cascading negative effects for affected realities.</p> <p>It's difficult to make different dimensional vessels interact with each other inside the Void. Because of this, many vessels have functions that allow them to conjoin their pseudo-realities with other pseudo-realities. Usually this requires consent from both sides as the mechanics are made far more difficult without access to both realities, but some recently developed military ships are capable of doing this on just one side. This poses possible consequences for the future of dimensional warfare and reality augmentation.</p> <p>The only way to make separate dimensional vessels interface with each other from different realities is to pack enough of them dense enough so that their forms in metaphysical space are touching. This creates a blockage in metaphysical space. After discovering this, metavessels have begun to employ metaphysical barrier projectors: machines that extend the ship\u2019s metaphysical form without extending its physical form.</p>"},{"location":"Worldbuilding/The%20Cosmos/Firmament%20Theory/#reality-composition","title":"Reality Composition","text":"<p>A reality is defined as a section of physical existence in the Void, the space between worlds.
