WHAM \u2013 an orderly ring of [] tendrils surface from the Void aperture and slam into it, knocking it backwards, circling Amirlith in seconds. Ari follows with a twist of her wings, shooting forwards like a cannonball as the Firmament FLASHES in the background. She arrives and COLLIDES feet first into the Equilibrium, before quickly SPINNING around and lacerating its face with red conjured claws. Gouges appear in its shimmering white head, the porcelain material flesh-like on the inside. Governance popups splash away from the Equilibrium.</p> <p>EXT.

Red tendrils EXTEND from her fingers, SHOOTING up to the sky. The firmament FLASHES, and the sky TURNS OFF. Portals to the Void OPEN UP across Amirlith\u2019s sky.

Ritual diagrams shone across its hull, granting it the magic to cross between realities. For now, it was docked atop the sky-dome of Kaaldenvale, a reality encompassing just a single planet, doing nothing. For any other fringe interdimensional organization, this would be a massive and wasteful expenditure. But for the Haelborne, it was but one of their silent, thousand-strong fleet, out plundering the cosmos like the others.</p> <p>This particular mission, however, was quite special. Both in terms of the objective\u2026 and who was involved.</p> <p>Aboard the ship, in one of the lounges, was a fae and a dysphorium.</p> <p>The fae were the local intelligent species of Kaaldenvale, somewhat resembling the elves of Earth folklore. Unlike those nature spirits, they were built for killing, evolved from highly predatory mammals \u2013 they bore such features as retractable cat-like claws, razor-sharp flexible ears, and jagged rows of teeth. This particular fae was a relatively recent recruit to the Haelborne cause, specifically for this mission. His name was Limril.</p> <p>The dysphorium were nothing like the fae. A population of thousands scattered across the cosmos, with nowhere to call home, they roamed realities, slaughtering thousands with the power of an unchained soul. There was nothing keeping it from committing mass genocide on a whim, except for a lucrative deal.</p> <p>This dysphorium was a nightmarish concoction. It had serrated blades incorporated into its limbs. Its face was dominated by a wide, ever-grinning mouth of sharp teeth. Its deep blue-grey hair floated in nonexistent wind, parted by a pair of twisting horns. From the rightmost horn hung an hourglass filled with blood red sand. Its name was Grim.</p> <p>The two were playing a local board game. Limril was unusually enthused for his nonchalant and apathetic demeanour. Grim was alternately moving pieces and tasting them.</p> <p>\u201cDamnit,\u201d Limril sighed. \u201cGrim, can you not eat those?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI could\u2026\u201d Grim spat a bunch of twisted wooden scraps out of its mouth. \u201cBut my contract tells me I have to not eat the people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow is that relevant?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow helpful.\u201d</p> <p>Limril sighed again and swept the board and pieces off the table. He waved his hand, and the board hovered its way across the floor and into a cupboard. Eyes dulling, he snatched a can of soda out of nothingness, popping it open and downing a gulp.</p> <p>\u201cSo,\u201d he said between sips. \u201cYou up for dispatch to Javenshard this week?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat-shard?\u201d Grim mumbled, its grin fracturing back to a mildly triumphant smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s to eat there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cJavenshard, Grim. A town. In Haelcrien. And you can\u2019t eat anyone until we get scouting done. And then we have to figure out the arrangement with the Felheils\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Grim blew a raspberry \u2013 which was quite odd looking, because it didn\u2019t have lips, and its tongue looked like a spiked mace made from red flesh.</p> <p>\u201cCan I go negotiate with those guys? I love eating \u2013 I mean EATING new people.\u201d</p> <p>Limril stared at it.</p> <p>\u201cFuck I said it twice. Anyway, why\u2019re we going there?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe Fundament Glass, Grim. The reason we recruited you in the first place?\u201d</p> <p>\"Recruited me? No, I think I recruited myself.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course you do. When you get powerful enough, it just seems like everything happens because you\u2019re around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt does because it\u2019s true. So why are we after a piece of glass?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf you keep playing dumb, I am going to report you to management.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow many calories is that worth?\u201d</p>"},{"location":"Story/Mainline%20Story/Advent%20of%20the%20Haelborne/#chapter-i-everything-stops","title":"Chapter I: Everything Stops","text":"<p>and that's on a literal and thematic level &gt;:D</p> <p>Hello there. Book. This is Aryon Hastor! I\u2019m writing this little tome of misfortunes to\u2026 document things. For future reference, in case I\u2026 well I don\u2019t know\u2026</p> <p>Is it just me or do \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 and \u2018IDK\u2019 have different meanings nowadays? Like, \u2018I don\u2019t know\u2019 is something the protagonist says after the comic relief guy asks in a really scared voice \u2018what are we going to do\u2019 or something like that. Then on the other hand \u2018IDK\u2019 is just pure cluelessness. No ominous connotations with that one.</p> <p>Oops. I went off on a tangent again. I gotta stop doing that.</p> <p>Back to the topic at hand. Which isn\u2019t really a topic. But whatever. Y\u2019know, it just occurred to me that anybody who finds this thing just dropped in a public building in another universe would think that top bit was just the author making a lazy excuse so their perspective character could write in first person. Completely hypothetically. Definitely not happening. Y\u2019know, not everything is sarcasm! People should stop being so cynical\u2026 not that I can talk. I\u2019m writing this as I walk down a forest path with my sister Bia. You might think this is a terrible idea and I should pay more attention while walking through a spooky scary forest while on the hunt for monsters. No, I\u2019m good. I\u2019m tier seven! That affords me a lot of attribute points - twenty-seven of which are in soul. I can multitask way better than a regular person. Took Bia and I six years to level this high -we\u2019ve nearly reached tier eight- and, oh, lemme tell ya, is it WORTH IT! I can run across the entirety of our town Javenshard in seconds!</p> <p>I glance over at Bia, who\u2019s merrily skipping down the trail. She\u2019s two years older than me - I\u2019m eighteen - and, contrary to the majority of sibling to sibling relationships, she\u2019s always the one annoying me, not the other way around.</p> <p>Bia is tall and slender, just over two metres. She has short but impeccably styled purple hair (a hallmark of the Hastor line). Every fae family has their own signature combination of colours \u2013 this is the Hastors,\u2019 and all of us have it - though I wear it better than Bia, of course. She wore her enchanted combat outfit, consisting of an armoured jacket with silver bands and long, airy pants. Her ears stretch out far longer than the average fae, expanding about ninety centimetres to each side (another hallmark of the Hastor line - we\u2019re really, uh, special). Three divots were carved into them from the bottom \u2013 ear shape was a feature unique to every fae, but us Hastors get more variety with how long ours are. Compared to Bia, I\u2019m some sort of gremlin. Height-wise. If that wasn\u2019t clear. I have to assume certain levels of disability in anybody reading this (because it\u2019s probably ME).</p> <p>I\u2019m short for a fae, only one and a bit metres tall. My hair\u2019s longer and is extremely messy. My ears droop downward a lot. I\u2019m wearing a parka with selective armour plating, with a red scarf layered over it. All my stuff has different enchantments that facilitate health regeneration and enhanced speed, to aid my really weird and unnecessarily risky combat style.</p> <p>\u201cThis is supremely stupid,\u201d I grumbled, panning my eyes across the trees.</p> <p>\u201cAhh, it\u2019s FINE!\u201d Bia replied, glancing down. \u201cThe monsters here aren\u2019t even that high level. They\u2019re only tier\u2026 what, thirteen?\u201d</p> <p>I stared back with glaring intensity. Bia could be an asshole, and it looked like she was about to start one of her episodes.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re tier seven.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell isn\u2019t that just spoopy. But please shut up and go find monsters already.\u201d</p> <p>Rolling my eyes, I summoned a weapon with the snap of a finger. A dagger flickered into existence in my hands. Its blade was made with deep purple crystal. Red trails shimmered throughout the crystal, twisting and swirling like hundreds of miniature snakes.</p> Ability: [Voidburst Dagger] (Conjuring) <p>Incantation: none.</p> <p>Cost: meagre mana</p> <p>Cooldown: none.</p> <p>Damage Output:</p> <p>Meagre, scaling with tier</p> <p>Ethereal:</p> <p>- 33.3% Void</p> <p>- 33.3% Light</p> <p>- 33.3% Reality</p> <p>Impact:</p> <p>- Stabbing</p> <p>Effect:</p> <p>Tier I</p> <p>Conjure a Voidburst Dagger</p> <p>Minor boost to mana pool, crit chance, and crit damage, scaling with tier.</p> <p>Dagger inflicts [Devitalized Manaturgy]</p> <p>Tier IV</p> <p>Inflicts [Adverse Manaturgy].</p> <p>Tier V</p> <p>Inflicts [Vampiric Manaturgy]</p> <p>Consume health to increase damage by a percentage three times the health sacrificed.</p> <p>Tier VI</p> <p>If target is below a third of their mana pool, minor increase to global damage output, scaling with tier.</p> <p>Tier VII</p> <p>Increase mana cost to moderate to inflict [Harmonic Manaturgy] on caster and wielder.</p> Effect: [Devitalized Manaturgy] (Weakening) <p>Slowly drains mana at a rate of meagre mana/id.</p> Effect: [Adverse Manaturgy] (Damage) <p>When target uses mana, deal damage one twelfth of mana used.</p> Effect: [Vampiric Manaturgy] (Draining) <p>One fourth of mana removed from the target, whether by the target or through external activity, is given to the user.</p> <p>If mana is removed by [Devitalized Manaturgy], extraction increases to one third.</p> <p>If mana is removed while [Adverse Manaturgy] is in effect, extraction increases to one third.</p> <p>If both [Devitalized Manaturgy] and [Adverse Manaturgy] are used, extraction increases to one half.</p> Effect: [Harmonic Manaturgy] (Damage) <p>Increase damage of [Adverse Manaturgy] from summoning, casting, conjuring, and ritual type abilities by (target\u2019s tier) %.</p> <p>I twirled the dagger in a showy way, before sliding it into a scabbard on my belt. This bad boy had slain a lot of monsters and was one of the first abilities I\u2019d acquired, from back when we first immigrated to Haelcrien and mother still had the heart and sanity to train me. From my belt pouch I took a metal tablet far larger than the pouch itself, yet somehow managing to fit inside.</p> <p>I tapped the tablet three times with a finger like I had done hundreds of times before. After a brief moment, lines engraved themselves into the metal, creating a radar interface. A quick scanning animation followed, before dots appeared around the area. I tapped the closest one.</p> Creature: [Crienbeast] (Beast) <p>Average Tier: III</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>A combination of rat and bear, with a bear\u2019s bulky body and fur, but a rat\u2019s tail and head. They possess sharp claws and teeth, razor tails, and a set of spikes along their backs that allow them to manipulate gravity to a small extent. They are unable to flip or otherwise redirect gravity but are able to lessen it temporarily in a small area.</p> <p>\u201cPack of crienbeasts, tier four, two hundred metres that way.\u201d</p> <p>Bia cackled. She held out her hand and chanted:</p> <p>\u201cFallen horrors in the gloom, come forth and ferry my doom.\u201d</p> <p>Red mist coalesced in her palm before expanding to form a massive scythe, with a blade of crimson metal and grip of black hide.</p> Ability: [Fel Scythe] (Conjuring) <p>Incantation: Fallen horrors in the gloom, come forth and ferry my doom</p> <p>Cost: meagre mana</p> <p>Cooldown: none.</p> <p>Damage Output:</p> <p>High, scaling with tier</p> <p>Ethereal:</p> <p>- 50% Necrotic</p> <p>- 50% Bleed</p> <p>Impact:</p> <p>- Cutting</p> <p>Effect:</p> <p>Tier I</p> <p>Conjure a Fel Scythe.

Continues to deal slowly deescalating damage for ten sec. before dropping off.</p> <p>Without another word, she dashes off into the forest, heading towards the pack of monsters ahead. Decimating local species time. I\u2019ve gotta write the rest of this after we finish fighting.</p> <p>I rolled my eyes, conjuring a pair of wings before launching after my sister.</p> Ability: [Wings of Equilibrium] (Utility) <p>Cost: meagre mana</p> <p>Cooldown: none.</p> <p>Damage Output:</p> <p>Low, scaling with tier</p> <p>Ethereal:</p> <p>- 50% Holy</p> <p>- 50% Unholy</p> <p>Impact:</p> <p>- Metaphysical</p> <p>- Cutting</p> <p>Effects:</p> <p>Tier I</p> <p>Conjure a pair of mismatched wings.

Projectiles can be redirected at enemies for a meagre mana cost.</p> <p>With a rush of wind, I landed in the middle of a forest clearing, immediately knocking several crienbeasts off their feet. As stressed as I was in this over-ranked area of the forest, the thrill of combat rushed me right into the zone. Brandishing my dagger, I immediately leapt at the nearest monster, the sheer force of the launch tearing the poor thing\u2019s head right off its body. It tumbled about for a few seconds while the rest of its Governance-given energy sapped away and it dissolved into a pile of assorted items. Normally monsters didn\u2019t dissolve so quickly, but I must\u2019ve hit that one too hard.</p> Info <p>[Enemy selected]</p> Info <p>[60%]</p> Info <p>[20%]</p> Info <p>[dead]</p> Info <p>You have defeated: [Crienbeast]</p> <p>Bia dashed into the clearing just a moment later. Her scythe flashed into a black and red blur, whirling to spear three beasts through the stomach. Viscera spilled, tendons ripped, lots of other yummy fleshy things fell on the ground. Yet the three crienbeasts still stood, courtesy of their enhanced tier four attributes.</p> Info <p>[Enemy selected] x3</p> Info <p>[40%]</p> Info <p>[dead]</p> Info <p>You have defeated: [Crienbeast] x3</p> <p>The poor creatures scrambled to re-assert their position \u2013 but NOPE, \u2018cause I\u2019m here to kick ass and other body parts too. A swarm of light blades dislodged from my outstretched hand, trailing fire and burning through poor, weak flesh. A second volley ensured their demise with a bonus free cremation (for free!).</p> Ability: [Rain of Light] (Attack) <p>Incantation: Let the blaze of dawn light the blasphemous mind</p> <p>Cost: meagre mana</p> <p>Cooldown: 30 sec.</p> <p>Damage Output:</p> <p>Medium, scaling with tier</p> <p>Ethereal:</p> <p>- 50% Light</p> <p>- 50% Flame</p> <p>Impact:</p> <p>- Stabbing</p> <p>Effect:</p> <p>Tier I</p> <p>Conjure a swarm of light spears.

This includes the life force of shadow-based and shadow-adjacent creatures.</p> Effect: [Blinding Descension] (Weakening) <p>Target acquires an affinity weakness to light and light-adjacent damages.</p> <p>The rat-bear hybrids rushed forwards in a wave, claws flashing and teeth gnashing. Rocks and chunks of earth lifted as they ran, the spines across their backs lighting up a soft green as the debris shot forward. That was a neat little ability of theirs \u2013 manipulating gravity in a small area around them. Anyway, let\u2019s let the little cuties run around a little more. It gets boring from here.</p> <p>Within the span of a minute, the entire pack lay dead and disembowelled across the forest floor.</p> Info <p>You have defeated: [Crienbeast] x6</p> <p>Ooh, aren\u2019t the wafting scents of burnt flesh so nice in the pristine outside air? I know, they really are.</p> <p>Leaves crunched as I stepped to the nearest body. I tapped a finger to the beast\u2019s temple, brushing the thing\u2019s fur with pleasure \u2013 there was loot to come.</p> Loot 1x [Crienbeast Tier IV]? <p>I ignored the Governance window and proceeded to tap the other corpses, as Bia did likewise on the other side of the clearing. Windows stacked up rapidly before they consolidating into one.</p> Loot 10x [Crienbeast Tier V]? <p>I mentally accepted the prompt, and ten bodies dissolved with a poof, leaving piles of neatly packaged monster parts scattered across the ground. Sheets of leather, bags of fur, bundled claws and spines. From Bia\u2019s position came another poof, quickly followed by a whoop of surprise.</p> <p>\u201cHoh!\u201d Bia called from across the clearing. \u201cThis guy dropped a core!\u201d</p> <p>I immediately spun around. In Bia\u2019s hand was what looked like a mangled electrical component, composed of a cube-shaped body and tangles of metal wire. Within the core shone a pulsing multicoloured light. These little things were manifestations of the Governance and were embedded in the bodies of all monsters it spawned. Rarely however, did one come out of the process in a usable state.</p> <p>I did not see what I just described, however. In Bia\u2019s hands was a pile of shining silver coins.</p> Item: [Depleted Lesser Governance Core] (Core) <p>Tier: IV</p> <p>Previously a [Lesser Governance Core], depleted after being used to construct a monster. Can be repurposed as a ritual or artifice component.</p> <p>\u201cNice.\u201d I shrugged, returning to collecting the other drops. I stuffed them all into a second belt pouch. Claws and fur, despite being too large to fit through the opening, simply shrunk as they approached the pouch before slotting into the dark space inside.</p> Item: [Extradimensional Sack] (Bag) <p>Tier: VII</p> <p>Manufactured by: Scruff &amp; Grime Leathers</p> <p>A simple run of the mill leather bag- but bigger on the inside. Item capacity: 40 m.3</p> <p>We gathered up the rest of the free money and trekked back into the trees and off to the shallower parts of the woods.</p> <p>\u201cWoo! What a haul!\u201d  Bia exclaimed excitedly. She snatched a metal tablet out of her own belt pouch, fingers flitting about across its surface in practiced motion, cataloguing our operation today. \u201cTwo commissions taken, and a ton of bonus loot. Ari \u2013 aye \u2013 whaddya say we take a day off tomorrow?\u201d</p> <p>I just stared silently at the dome of scattered lights in the sky. Sorry Bia, I tune out a lot. This late in the day, the stars cast dim orange light onto the ground, though some of them had turned off entirely.</p> <p>\u201cHuh? Oh,\u201d I muttered, returning her gaze to the forest in front of her. \u201cIt\u2019s almost stardown. We should go faster.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoring,\u201d Bia chimed out, sliding the tablet away and jamming her hands in her pockets in a popping motion. \u201cNightime\u2019s fun! That\u2019s when all the real spooping monsters come out!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cY\u2019know, I have a mild suspicion that that\u2019s definitely not a good thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re no fun. I\u2019m going to leave now, meet you at home later!\u201d</p> <p>In one movement spanning less than a second, she had completely disappeared from sight. With a blink, I pulled at the energy behind my eyes. A red sigil appeared in my vision, becoming smaller as it mapped itself onto my retreating sister\u2019s back.</p> <p>\u201cVery funny!\u201d I called. \u201cGet back here!\u201d</p> <p></p> <p>There was no response. The sigil became smaller, but I could still see in perfect clarity. Perks of levelling so high.</p> <p>\u201cBia!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBIA!\u201d</p> <p>I sighed and continued through the melancholic forest. I walked at a leisurely pace, trying to conjure up some thoughts in my solitude. But my mind was empty. Adamantly content to simply observe the world.</p> <p>I should stop being poetic.</p> <p>Nah, fuck that.</p> <p>Trees stretched into unidentifiable shapes.</p> <p>Leaves chattered in whispers of forgotten languages.</p> <p>Birds chirped and called distantly.</p> <p>The shadows seemed\u2026 particularly mocking. Like a really really expressive chandelier.</p> <p>And then everything stopped.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the- \u201c</p> <p>At first, I thought I\u2019d gone deaf. In a place a tier zero would hear nothing, a tier seven could hear the smallest flickers in the environment, from the crawling of insects across the mildewed surfaces to the dripping of minuscule waters from trees to soft dirt.</p> <p>But no, it wasn\u2019t me.</p> <p>Silence rang in an almost tangible wave. Something was wrong, something fundamental. I summoned my dagger, slowly turning on the spot, scanning the trees. Nothing else dared move or make noise as a Presence settled over the forest. I couldn\u2019t distinguish any of its elements. It was a maelstrom of madness, merry and ecstatic with the cold promise of eternal unexistence.</p> <p>I blinked, expecting another red sigil to appear. Nothing.</p> <p>There were two explanations for this.</p> <p>A: Something is nearby. Something far more powerful than myself. More powerful than anything I had ever fought, judging by what I felt in that Presence.</p> <p>B: I am tripping balls.</p> <p>My eyes slashed across the trees, picking out anything out of place before spotting it: a faint blur speeding forward. Cracks and groans echoed from its position as if reality strained where it stepped.</p> <p>It was way too fast for me to run away. At least tier fourty based on that one time I watched skilled adventurers fighting higher-tier monsters in Troltano. I couldn\u2019t match its physical speed, but I had years of combat experience. On pure instinct \u2013 without even a thought \u2013 an array of translucent blue shields sprang up in front of me, just in time to meet a swarm of metal blades.</p> Ability: [Shattersweep Shield] (Defence) <p>Incantation: none</p> <p>Cost: meagre mana</p> <p>Cooldown: 30 sec.</p> <p>Damage Output:</p> <p>Low, scaling with tier</p> <p>Ethereal:</p> <p>- 90% Light</p> <p>- 10% Mystic</p> <p>Impact:</p> <p>- Blunt</p> <p>- Stabbing</p> <p>Effects:</p> <p>Tier I</p> <p>Conjure a floating shield. When hit, will absorb damage up to moderate damage, shatter, and send shards at the enemy, each dealing meagre shrapnel damage.</p> <p>Tier II</p> <p>Shards inflict [Fracture]. You can chain-conjure up to six shields, but each one will be less effective than a regular one.</p> <p>Tier IV</p> <p>Throw the shield as a projectile, periodically stunning and knocking back anything in its path. Shards detach from the main shield as it moves, each dealing moderate stabbing damage.</p> <p>Tier VI</p> <p>Merge up to three shields to form a larger shield. Larger shields cannot be used as projectiles but will follow user and can be moved in a small radius around the user.</p> <p>Tier VII</p> <p>You may now conjure up to twelve shields, each at the base mana cost.</p> Effect: [Fracture] (Weakening) <p>Target becomes more susceptible to ethereal damage and is occasionally hit with some void damage and multiplies this effect. Effect stacks.</p> <p>The shields shattered. Stupid me, assuming my puny tier seven power could hold up to random tentacle monsters.</p> <p>Blue shards danced outwards explosively before dissolving. In the split second time it took for the strikes to break through, I pulled my arms up to block the strike \u2013 and had them utterly eviscerated.</p> <p>Blood spattered everywhere, strips of flesh peeling away. Tendons slithered out of my scrambled arms, pain flaring as the copper smell of blood wilted away from ripped meat.</p> <p>So much useless, powerless meat.</p> Info <p>HP: [50%]</p> <p>I stood there for a few seconds, almost disbelievingly.</p> <p>It had been so long since I\u2019d seen my own blood.</p> <p>\u201cShit\u2026\u201d</p> <p>It was at this point that poor little Aryon Hastor realized\u2026 that she had supremely fucked up.</p> <p>I glanced up at the monster.</p> <p>\u201cShit, shit, shit, shit.\u201d</p> <p>Eight eyes glowed with bright red glee, arranged in a circle surrounding a gaping jaw of metallic teeth. Dark hair floated in flailing strands, drifting through a nonexistent wind.</p> <p>Why wasn\u2019t it attacking?</p> <p>Oh yeah. This would be a supremely comedic moment when it slapped me sixteen metres backwards through seventeen trees. I should probably\u2026 run?</p> <p>\u201cNope, nope \u2013 NOPE, GOODBYE!\u201d I screamed as I conjured my wings and launched into the sky. \u201cI think I\u2019ll just be going this way now and you\u2019re not gonna get anywhere closer or I don\u2019t damn know what I\u2019ll do MAYBE I SHOULD STOP HYPERVENTILATING AND FUCKING RUN!\u201d</p> <p>The whistling of wind through metal sounded as black tendrils topped with wicked blades surfaced around me. The entity barrelled upwards, closer, closer, closer and closer. I turned around just long enough for the Governance to analyze the monster. A window appeared in the corner of my vision. It didn\u2019t help \u2013 in fact, I was now MORE panicked.</p> Being: [Unknown] (Dysphorium (Alt. 3152)) <p>[Obfuscated]</p> <p>Entity does not have a root in Governance system</p> <p>Entity shares foreign magic system equivalent of your title [Dormant]</p> <p>\u201cWHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!!!! WHAT ARE YOU??!!!!!!!\u201d I half cried. I flung light blades at the thing, screaming and crying my way upwards. Cackling drifted through the rancid air as a massive metal claw snatched me downwards. Debris detonated from the impact as I was slammed against a tree. The entity didn\u2019t move it\u2019s main body, instead pushing me up the trunk with the claw attached to its tentacle.</p> <p>It rattled its way closer, taking its time. Its Presence grew stronger, the layers of reality bending and warping as it slashed forwards, limbs distending with snaps and crackles. Finally, it reached the foot of the tree. Its head snapped upwards, eyes piercing my skull as it concentrated its Presence towards me. This was a technique only known by the most elite of adventurers. No sound could escape my lips.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cHello there!\u201d the entity cheered happily, like a preschooler with a new toy. \u201cI\u2019m Grim!\u201d</p> <p>Silence. I physically could not talk \u2013 the Presence still screaming in my veins.</p> <p>\u201cOh, not up for a talk then? Funny! Straight to the chase then\u2026\u201d Grim\u2019s eye sockets narrowed. It had no pupils, but this still achieved a look of persecution \u2013 or, to be less descriptive, a look of \u2018I\u2019m going to kill you and everyone you love and then I\u2019m going to steal your tendons to make a blanket.\u2019 \u201cWould you be so kind as to hand over the Firmament Hourglass?\u201d</p> <p>The Presence relaxed slightly.</p> <p>The Presence relaxed slightly.</p> <p>The Presence relaxed slightly.</p> <p>\u201cW-what?\u201d I shuddered, heart pounding through my chest. The trinket under my scarf seemed to become heavier.</p> <p>Grim\u2019s eyes narrowed further. It sighed and dragged its hand upwards. It had no fingers \u2013 the end of its forearm instead hosted three serrated, articulated metal claws. With a movement faster than I could see, it pulled my necklace out from under my scarf. At the end of the chain was that tiny hourglass, filled with blood red sand.</p> <p>Oh, oh yeah. I definitely know what it wants.</p> <p>\u201cThis little trinket around your neck, of course!\u201d</p> <p>So, I was stuck in a very bad position. I could be loyal and keep the treasure my clinically insane mother had adamantly told me several thousand times not to lose \u2013 or I could save my own life.</p> <p>Wanna guess which one I went with?</p> <p>\u201cUh, no.\u201d</p> <p>This was a completely rational and logical decision. You can imagine me giving a thumbs up right now.</p> <p>The Presence returned in an instant, a reality-shattering aura thundering into place. Screams and wails echoed through my ears, the smell of soot and ash burning through my skull like the spilled internal bodily fluids of hundreds of ended lives. Another tentacle, this one topped with a massive scythe, unlatched itself from Grim\u2019s back and ripped into my chest. Frankly, it was a miracle I was still alive. Tier seven blood coursed out of the wound, the vital force keeping her together spilling by the litre.</p> Info <p>HP: [40%]</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps I was not clear enough?\u201d Grim cackled. \u201cHonestly man, I\u2019m STARVING. Best give me the little thingy or I\u2019ll be forced to \u2013 eheheh \u2013 have a snack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have to uh \u2013 uh \u2013 go somewhere, I have \u2013 like, an appointment with my\u2026 anarchist!\u201d</p> <p>Grim raised another claw-hand. It dug further into my ribcage, tossing out various organs before picking up my heart and casually popping it into its mouth.</p> Info <p>HP: [5%]</p> <p>I had no lungs to scream. No biggie. I\u2019m sure everything will turn out okay. Sarcastic optimism is my coping mechanism!</p> <p>\u201cRelinquish the hourglass please,\u201d Grim chittered, its tone as goofy as ever.</p> <p>I could only cough and splutter. This, however, was an advanced battle tactic known as DECEPTION, BITCH!</p> <p>This method is also known as saving your most powerful move until the end of the fight for dramatic effect and definitely not because I\u2019m too much of scaredy cat to manage logical thinking in a near death situation.</p> <p>I raised a hand in a casting position, pointed at Grim. Four fingers stretched out as far forward as possible, the pinky folded backwards across the bottom of the thumb. There was a moment of silence, as Grim curiously tilted its head. Ooh, it had no idea.</p> <p>I pulled at the energy under my eyes. Four red circles burned indents into my thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers. I grunted in pain.</p> <p>Tendrils of piercing red light blasted from my fingers. Crackling erupted at an ear-piercing pitch as the red lightning shot towards Grim and sent the thing flying off hundreds of kilometres into the horizon. Panting, I fell to the ground, clutching the gaping hole in my chest. The flesh had already started to knit back together \u2013 thank the Immortals for ranked-up healing kicking in.</p> <p>Crawling into a comfortable position, I reached into my extradimensional pouch, fumbling about before snatching out a massive bottle. It had an unbalanced top and bottom, almost like one of those kids\u2019 science worksheets we did in first grade.</p> Item: [Reinforced Glass Bottle] (Container) <p>Tier: VII</p> <p>Contains: [Greater Sustenance Elixir]</p> <p>Manufactured by: Five Brothers Alchemical Goods</p> <p>A glass bottle with magical reinforcements, meant to contain powerful potions.</p> Potion: [Greater Sustenance Elixir] (Restoration) <p>Tier: VII</p> <p>Manufactured by: Five Brothers Alchemical Goods</p> <p>A potion that can completely restore missing health and mana.</p> <p>I ripped off the cork and downed all the silver liquid inside. My wounds healed even faster, flesh and sinew flashing and flailing until it looked like there was never any damage at all. It was half a minute before I moved. Even though it had physically healed me, it wasn\u2019t able to cure exhaustion.</p> <p>Once the potion had done its job, I shambled upright. Again lifting an arm in casting position, I waved it in a ring and the red energy cut a hole in the world. Through the tear was my bedroom \u2013 not that my dreary state could interpret what I was seeing. This entire portal wasn\u2019t even a conscious action. On instinct, I needed my bed. I slouched through the portal, collapsing on the plank floor of the room, before rolling to stare upwards. My vision faded to black, the last thing I saw the tinkling of candlelight against the grey ceiling.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Story/Mainline%20Story/Advent%20of%20the%20Haelborne/#chapter-ii-vacation","title":"Chapter II: Vacation...?","text":"<p>do I at least get paid</p> <p></p> <p>The slamming of a door some distance away snapped me out of unconsciousness. I was lying across the wood-panelled floor of my bedroom, surrounded by a ring of ripped flesh and dried blood. Likely discarded material from after the potion kicked in. I glanced at the walls, clustered with shelves and shelves of assorted books, monster skulls, and painting canvas. Silently, I clambered upright, only to collapse against the wall next to the door. With a jerking motion, I slammed open the door with a slap of the hand, throwing myself against the upstairs railing as if fired from a slingshot. Movement with a fully repaired body after being recently near-deceased is a little tricky.</p> <p>A coughing fit ensued as I snapped up to take the stairs down before \u2013</p> <p>\u201cAri!\u201d Bia\u2019s voice sang loudly from below. \u201cYou in here?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cY-yes,\u201d I spluttered, dragging my feet as I staggered down to our living room. Bia stood next to the table, looking expectantly at the stairs. Her grin faded. A terrible omen \u2013 Bia is always making that evil grin of hers.</p> <p>\u201cWhat the hell happened?\u201d Bia immediately dropped all pretence of her usual giddiness. \u201cI just got back from stealing Dan\u2019s bottles, what did you do?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI got attacked by a demon, that\u2019s what!\u201d I refueled with energy, glaring daggers at Bia. \u201cThis is why we don\u2019t go ANYWHERE near the deep woods. While you were off pilfering the pub, I was getting mauled against by a bleeding ten foot tall metal monster!\u201d</p> <p>Bia paused, a rare look of hesitation on her face.</p> <p>\u201cAnd\u2026 what monster was it?\u201d</p> <p>Wordlessly, I sent over the Governance profile generated for the entity. With that done, I fell violently onto the couch, lying there contemplatively. In retrospect, the entire scene was a little kooky; it looked as if Bia was running a therapy session (which, Immortals forbid, she was definitely not qualified to do).</p> <p>Bia read over the profile several times, eyes seeing but not comprehending \u2013 though that\u2019s what she usually did. Dumbass.</p> &gt; Item mailed from [Aryon Hastor] <p>Being: [Unknown] (Dysphorium (Alt. 3152))</p> <p>[Obfuscated]</p> <p>Entity does not have a root in Governance system</p> <p>Entity shares foreign magic system equivalent of your title [Dormant]</p> <p>\u201c\u2019Not rooted in Governance system?\u2019 And it shares your Dormant title, but in another magic system?\u201d She coughed nervously. \u201cLast I checked, we\u2019re not living in a fantasy novel, right?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow in the twelve hells am I supposed to know?\u201d I hyperventilated. \u201cIt hit me twice and I was near dead, I wasn\u2019t contemplating the existence of something that isn\u2019t compatible with the system our society has grown with since \u2013 since the Miruen Empire!\u201d</p> <p>Bia stared out the living room window at the black night. You could just barely see the houses along our street.</p> <p>\u201cWe should tell someone this thing is in the forest. Nothing tier thirteen should be able to take out Ms. Perfect Hastor that easily.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNothing at all should be able to take out any Hastor that easily,\u201d I said, the still-lingering panic overriding her name calling. \u201cHow it even got through my passive sensory is a complete mystery. And who would we tell? You think the mayor of this dump can do anything about it? We specifically picked a low rank place like Javenshard to settle down \u2013 so we wouldn\u2019t have to deal with crazy stuff like this!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou specifically picked Javenshard so you wouldn\u2019t have to deal with crazy stuff like this,\u201d Bia rolled her eyes, and added in a mutter. \u201cCoward.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou shut it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, you,\u201d She retorted with a natural cadence. That was one of her most used phrases, and it was so very annoying. \u201cWe can travel over to Troltano and go tell Father ourselves. Or find someone high-tier to take out the thing \u2013 Troltano is a tier fifty-sixty area.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not going all the way out there while that demon is still around.\u201d</p> <p>Bia raised an eyebrow. \u201cWhy? It\u2019s just a monster. It\u2019ll find other prey and should know better than to go near busy, established roads, much less follow you about.\u201d</p> <p>I opened her mouth, then closed it, then sighed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not after me. It\u2019s after Mother\u2019s hourglass.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou- \u201c Bia spluttered. \u201cWhat? It\u2019s sentient? It\u2019s not an actual monster?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Monsters are fabricated by the Governance to feed faevinity experience, you know this? So, what kind of monster is intelligently motivated not by sadism, but by a specific shiny trinket?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy would it want the hourglass? The thing can\u2019t use the glass\u2019 powers, can it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t think so. It didn\u2019t show off any reality-bending. But hells, I don\u2019t know! It\u2019s a spooky shadow demon, we didn\u2019t learn about those in adventuring school.\u201d</p> <p>\u201dCheck the glass. Is there something on it? Some kind of tracking device? Anything?\u201d</p> <p>I gently pulled out the hourglass from my shirt. The blood red sands tinkled softly as the trinket moved.</p> Item: [Old Hourglass] (Accessory) <p>Tier: I</p> <p>A family heirloom of the Hastor line. Do not lose it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still the same as ever,\u201d I sighed, disappointed. \u201cPerhaps I should report this to someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still the same as ever,\u201d I sighed, disappointed. \u201cPerhaps I should report this to someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s still the same as ever,\u201d I sighed, disappointed. \u201cPerhaps I should report this to someone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAri you selectively deaf dumbass I said that a minute ago.\u201d Bia exclaimed. \u201cIf that thing gets into Javenshard it\u2019s going to obliterate everyone. Nobody here is high enough tier to even stand in front of it. Except for Mother, but you know what she\u2019s been like since\u2026\u201d</p> <p>I groaned. \u201cY\u2019know, I could just send Father a letter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, you know what he\u2019s like too. He won\u2019t listen to us unless we go slap in him the face ourselves. Besides, a trip will be fun! We\u2019ve been cooped up here for years, we gotta go somewhere else eventually.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd the matter of the murder monster after my face?\u201d I glared.</p> <p>Bia smiled sweetly, leaned forward.</p> <p>\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be fine. Can we just have a regular, fun, vacation...?\u201d</p> <p>I only glared harder, purple pupils boring past a sheaf of hair and straight into Bia\u2019s eyes. After a second of silence in which you could practically hear the cartoonishly escalating sound effect-</p> <p>\u201cFine.\u201d I relented. \u201cI suppose it was about time I fought something higher rank.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHells yeah!\u201d Bia pumped her fist. \u201cNice. We should leave\u2026 tomorrow morning?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cFair enough. I don\u2019t have much to pack.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes\u2026 I\u2019ll call on Golden Boy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLloyd? Why?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, and the Verosavens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou want to bring them along too?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not? It\u2019ll be a fun little vacation!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d I started, extremely unenthused. \u201cWell\u2026 as far as I care it\u2019s purely business. And Dan and Rosa are tier threes with non-combat specialties. They won\u2019t last long if that thing comes after us, or if we\u2019re out hunting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThey can sit the fighting out,\u201d Bia shrugged nonchalantly. \u201cIf the thing\u2019s after your hourglass it won\u2019t care about them.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut \u2013 you - whatever\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Bia pumped her fist again. It was extensively rare for me to put up with her bullshit, much less agree with said bullshit. A victory for her \u2013 I\u2019d do something petty about it but I\u2019m too exhausted from almost fucking dying. Grinning, Bia stalked over to the stairs and began climbing.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna go get some sleep,\u201d she chittered. \u201cI\u2019d suggest you do that too. We\u2019re leaving seven in the morning tomorrow.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNoon,\u201d I called, my gaze not leaving the ceiling as Bia ascended the staircase.</p> <p>\u201cNine!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNoon, Bia.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNine.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI hate you.\u201d</p> <p>Bia laughed and vanished upstairs.</p> <p>***</p> <p>I stalked my way through the forest trail, legs ripping right through the thorns and brambles. Weak early morning sunlight shone through the forest canopy, lighting up the blooming flowers scattered throughout the underbrush. Small streams ran about the weeds, blighting the dirt with moisture. Though I was reluctant to leave the vicinity of Javenshard, I suppose we had earned a vacation. I\u2019d worked hard to keep adventuring, and Bia\u2026 ahh, Bia did her best. I sound like Mother. Speaking of\u2026</p> <p>Her cabin was nestled in a jungle of bushes and vines. Stepping over a discarded watering can and towards the door, the soggy wooden steps creaked under my boots. I paused, cringed, but continued on. I knocked thrice.</p> <p>For a moment, there was silence. I edged backwards against the rain-soaked railing.</p> <p>Brisk footsteps tapped their way forward and paused too, and then the door swung open.</p> <p>Duskir Hastor was seventy years old, but she looked only thirty thanks to a hard-earned tier sixty-seven life force. She still had at least a century left \u2013 one of the reasons many fae devoted themselves to ranking up. Eighty years always felt too short for me, even with my own extra time.</p> <p>Mother wore a colourful poncho over a generic set of casual clothing. Her hair was deep purple like all the Hastors. Wild, violet eyes darted around the forest, unable to focus.</p> <p>\u201cHello, Ari,\u201d Duskir mumbled, still looking everywhere but at me. \u201cWhat brings you to my cabin?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have a request for you,\u201d I said.</p> <p>Duskir looked around hesitantly.</p> <p>\u201cMother.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c\u2026come in.\u201d</p> <p>She scrambled back into the house and slammed the door. Typical Mother. I opened the door again and stepped inside, carefully closing it behind me. Duskir sat in a rocking chair in front of a table, which was placed uncannily in the centre of the room. She never lit it; the crystal matrix kept the cabin heated had been on for years and I\u2019m pretty sure she\u2019d forgotten it existed. There was only one other chair in the room; Duskir didn\u2019t have guests. I sat casually.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cSo, dear,\u201d Duskir asked mechanically. \u201cWhat bothers you?\u201d</p> <p>I leaned forward conspiratorially.</p> <p>\u201cI was attacked in the forest last night. By something that shouldn\u2019t have been in there. Something nobody in Javenshard can fight, except for you.\u201d</p> <p>Duskir\u2019s eyes narrowed, a rare spark of sanity entering her gaze.</p> <p>\u201cShow me your logs.\u201d</p> <p>I mailed over the entity\u2019s Governance description.</p> &gt; Item mailed from [Aryon Hastor] <p>Being: [Unknown] (Dysphorium (Alt. 3152))</p> <p>[Obfuscated]</p> <p>Entity does not have a root in Governance system</p> <p>Entity shares foreign magic system equivalent of your title [Dormant]</p> <p>\u201cWhat in the\u2026\u201d Duskir glared at the message accusatorially. She sprang up, hands drooping oddly at the sides. \u201cYou aren\u2019t pranking me, are you?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t help you fight that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou know what it is?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, and I can\u2019t help you.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThen what is it?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou said you knew!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve met it, but I don\u2019t know what it is.\u201d</p> <p>I groaned. With Mother, it was more likely she had known but forgot.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I said in exasperation. With a flourish, I lifted the hourglass necklace over my head and placed it on the coffee table. \u201cWhat can you tell me about this?\u201d</p> <p>Duskir leaned forward.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I said in exasperation. With a flourish, I lifted the hourglass necklace over my head and placed it on the coffee table. \u201cWhat can you tell me about this?\u201d</p> <p>Duskir leaned forward.</p> <p>\u201cNever mind that,\u201d I said in exasperation. With a flourish, I lifted the hourglass necklace over my head and placed it on the coffee table. \u201cWhat can you tell me about this?\u201d</p> <p>Duskir leaned forward.</p> <p>The sands tinkled softly.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t that\u2026\u201d Duskir started. \u201cThat\u2019s the Hastor hourglass. You know what that is.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTell me, is it valuable?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLooking to sell it?\u201d Her eyes narrowed dangerously \u2013 though her pupils still didn\u2019t focus. \u201cDon\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHow tragic,\u201d I said in deadpan. \u201cHere, Mother, would you like a drink?\u201d</p> <p>I reached into my dimensional sack and pulled out a filled teacup, handing it to Duskir.</p> Item: [Polished Teacup] (Silverware) <p>Tier: Zero</p> <p>Contains: Bottled Truth</p> <p>Manufactured by: Drehmali Southern Utilities</p> <p>A simple and effective teacup.</p> <p>Enchantments: Disguise I</p> Enchantment: [Disguise] (Deception) <p>Effects:</p> <p>Change the name of an item or other valid Governance entry of or connected to enchanted item.</p> Potion: [Bottled Truth] (Deceptive) <p>Tier: L</p> <p>Produced by: Altegan Alchemical</p> <p>Induces a trance-like state that forces the user to tell the truth.</p> <p>Duskir gazed at it until it her own Governance instance analyzed it. I\u2019m not the best with anything other than fighting, really, so I\u2019d been up all last night trying to fix this thing up. Quite proud of the results. Of course, I didn\u2019t brew the potion, just did the enchantment. Tier fifty is too high for a measly tier seven like myself with mediocre brewing skills.</p> Item: [Polished Teacup] (Silverware) <p>Tier: Zero</p> <p>Contains: Roriodoan Tea</p> <p>Manufactured by: Drehmali Southern Utilities</p> <p>A simple and effective teacup.</p> Potion: [Roriodoan Tea] (Tea) <p>Tier: Zero</p> <p>Manufactured by: Roriodo Farms Inc.</p> <p>A soft tea produced from the meadows of the Roriodo River.</p> <p>\u201cThank you, Ari,\u201d she said, taking a sip. \u201cI\u2019ve always loved the local teas. They taste\u2026 honest\u2026 \u2026honest\u2026 \u2026honest\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, indeed.\u201d I said mock-professionally. \u201cIn fact, I brewed some of this myself. I\u2019m learning, aye?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, it tastes wonderful, dear.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOf course it does, I made it,\u201d Oof. Shouldn\u2019t have said that. \u201cNow, what can you tell me about the hourglass?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an old family heirloom.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd where did the Hastors get it?\u201d</p> <p>Duskir\u2019s eyes suddenly sharpened again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not at liberty to disclose that information.\u201d</p> <p>But my eyes sharpen better. That\u2019s completely irrelevant, but I\u2026 I don\u2019t know what my point here is, actually. This is a dead end. Here, have some more cool dialogue.</p> <p>\u201cWhy, have another sip.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think I\u2019ll pa\u2013 \u201c</p> <p>A line of red lightning sprang from my fingers, snapping Duskir\u2019s arms in place.</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p> <p>My other hand sparked lightning, picking up the teacup and tipping it down her throat.</p> Title: [Reality Warper] <p>Gives the user the ability to manipulate reality. This title is unrestricted but does not draw on mana, rather the user\u2019s soul itself. Due to the stress it puts on the soul, it effectively grows in strength as the user\u2019s soul does. Reality manipulation includes: reshaping/repurposing matter, duplicating matter, voiding matter, conjuring matter, and more.</p> <p>\u201cWhere is the hourglass from?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt was procured by Matriarch Raelia,\u201d Duskir spoke, her voice now lacking what little cadence it had before.</p> <p>\u201cAnd who is Raelia?\"</p> <p>\u201cThat \u2013 that is\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cUseful to me,\u201d I growled. The teacup tipped more potion into Duskir\u2019s mouth. She went limp, twitching as she spoke.</p> <p>\u201cShe arrived in the northern lands of the old Miruen Empire \u2013 just before the Empire itself fell. The first of the Hastor line. She claimed to be a deific entity and was the first of our line.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSo, one of them con artists then,\u201d I remarked, hands fidgeting with a spark of reality energy. It dissipated against my chair armrest. \u201cDoes the hourglass do anything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs far as I know, it only enhances reality-bending abilities,\u201d Duskir\u2019s voice seemed to be sputtering out. Possibly a bad sign? Nah, it\u2019s fine. \u201cIt allows us to use them for longer without spontaneously combusting.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s very enlightening Mother, I already knew that. So why do I have it?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am to pass it down to the next eligible Hastor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy not Bia?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe refused it.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHuh.\u201d</p> <p>For the first time here, I was confused. I couldn\u2019t see Bia \u2013 or anyone \u2013 turning down something like that. Hells, I\u2019ll take any free item to even slightly enhance my abilities. More efficient monster hunting, more money.</p> <p>\u201cWell, this has been somewhat productive.\u201d I gestured towards the door. \u201cI\u2019m going to... leave.\u201d</p> <p>I waved and left the cabin.</p> <p>I pondered the information I\u2019d stolen from Mother. I felt a little bad, feeding her a potion like that, but it was the easiest way to get to what I needed. Though, now that I think it over, this information wasn\u2019t worth much. It\u2019s nothing pivotal. She\u2019s just told me some generic worldbuilding crap that isn\u2019t useful to the plot. Why does Grim want this thing? It\u2019s just some old shiny trinket that it can\u2019t even use because it doesn\u2019t have the Hastors\u2019 specific abilities.</p> <p>It has to have some sort of agenda. Or is it working under someone else\u2019s agenda???</p> <p>Grim was insanely powerful. If it was working for something else, what kind of power did they have?</p> <p>***</p> <p>I sat on a stool in the Bearcroft Inn. No one else was in the building, as it was several hours before the usual opening time at noon. The inn was owned by Dan Verosaven, one of my childhood friends and one of the three Bia had invited along on their trip. We were supposed to meet here at seven with all our stuff packed (and with \u2018a good attitude\u2019, said Bia). Despite my previous complaint abouting getting up so early, I\u2019d somehow ended up here before everyone else.</p> <p>I was drowsily slouched over the bar, reading a book and only comprehending half the words. A shot glass was left empty on the counter. I had no reservations about drinking \u2013 good ol\u2019 tier seven me was more than capable of processing alcohol in far larger doses than a regular normie fae. The headache and insomnia were more a result of the brutal beating from Grim. Magical healing was intensely potent at fixing physical damage, but often caused minor aftereffects as backlash.</p> <p>The creaking of the half-polished front door roused me from my half-sleep.</p> <p>\u201cWoah, early today?\u201d Bia called dryly. \u201cNot slacking? Who, Aryon?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMorning, Ari,\u201d Dan followed with his scruffy, deep voice.</p> <p>The Verosaven family was descended from an older line of craftsmen dynasties, all of which had a dark bluish-grey hair and bright orange eye colour. Dan was a twenty year old fae, with voluminous hair and a small beard, with a noble facial structure and eyes that were either expressly bored or jovially amused. His ears were regular fae length, just ten centimetres. A single barb hung at the ends of his ears, curving upwards to meet a strangely blocky formation. He wore a dishevelled tweed jacket over some casual clothes, his hands stuck firmly in his pant pockets.</p> <p>\u201cAhh!\u201d I called. \u201cGood morning Dan. Where\u2019s Rosa?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo \u2018good morning\u2019 for me?\u201d Bia asked in mock hurt. \u201cI\u2019m offended.\u201d</p> <p>Dan shook his head and walked over to the counter to set down his backpack.</p> <p>\u201cBe offended,\u201d I scoffed. \u201cIt makes me feel better.\u201d</p> <p>Bia raised a finger and was about to speak before the door slammed open and right into her face.</p> <p>\u201cWHAT\u2019S UP?\u201d A voice screamed at the top of her lungs.</p> <p>Rosalith Verosaven pranced in with her usual over energetic demeanour, spinning and waving her arms like maniac, blue-grey ponytail flailing about like a whip. She wore a baggy bright orange hoodie, obscuring her one and a half metre frame. Rosa was the youngest of our group, born three years earlier than her brother. Her ears were a short six centimetres.</p> <p>Funny little thing about the Verosavens. Back when they had Dan, they were kinda struggling for money. Lower class families here in this continent named their children with less syllables than higher classes. Then, a few years later, they sorta stumbled into a bit of an absolute bloody fortune just lying in the woods. Some kind of fully intact Governance component left behind by some monster.</p> <p>It was around this time they had Rosa, and with their newfound fortune they could afford some more syllables. Of course, it\u2019s not like they actually had to buy longer names. Just a culture thing that everyone respects around here - plus, it makes a goofy little anecdote I can use to break up the monotony of these idiots\u2019 dialogue.</p> <p>\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d Bia moaned in pain, creaking upright and rubbing her nose.</p> <p>Dan waved silently from behind the counter, not looking up from whatever he was retrieving from the cabinet.</p> <p>\u201cOh, hello Rosa,\u201d I said. She glared at Bia, slumped against the wall, her groans getting steadily more comical. \u201cShut it, you. You\u2019re tier seven, stop being theatrical.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTheatrical?!\u201d Bia decried. \u201cWhy, I am in utmost pain! Have you no respect for the needy-\u201c</p> <p>A blade of light swung outwards from my wrist, stabbing into the wood next to Bia\u2019s throat with a twang. The quiet noise of simmering wood filled the room for a brief few seconds before the blade disintegrated.</p> <p>\u201cAs I said,\u201d Ari cooed, miming blowing steam off a gun. \u201cShut your oral aperture in punctual time, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHypocrite,\u201d Bia muttered. \u201cAnd a pedant too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAs I said,\u201d Ari cooed, miming blowing steam off a gun. \u201cShut your oral aperture in punctual time, please.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHypocrite,\u201d Bia muttered. \u201cAnd a pedant too.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAri, please don\u2019t fuck up my walls,\u201d Dan chuckled, going back to his counter before popping out with a closed sign. \u201cAh, here we are,\u201d he continued to the silent room. He walked over to the front door and hung the sign across the door.</p> <p>BEARCROFT INN CLOSED RENT IS NO LONGER DUE</p> <p>Dan slowly walked over to a seat and sat down, pulling out a notepad and pencil.</p> <p>\u201cAhem,\u201d Rosa loudly cleared her throat. \u201cSo\u2026 Bia, where\u2019re we off ta? Ya said Ari had to go report some kinda HOA bullshit?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s extremely inaccurate,\u201d I laughed. \u201cI was attacked by a demon.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpooky.\u201d Rosa said in a bored voice. \u201cSo, yes, HOA bullshit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat kind of logic - \u201c \u201cA pair of large, obese ls.\u201d I dragged a hand over my face. Rosalith was equal parts annoying and enjoyable in conversation.</p> <p>\u201cRosa, you didn\u2019t steal some of my stock too didya?\u201d Dan called, then pointed at Bia. \u201cAnd I know what you did last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAbsolutely no idea what you are talking about, Dan,\u201d Bia said cheerfully.</p> <p></p> <p>\u201cOkay then\u2026\u201d Dan said, narrowing his eyes.</p> <p>\u201cNice,\u201d Bia said. \u201cNow that these unfounded accusations have been cleared\u2026 We all here?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re missing -\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThanks for the cue Ari - WHERE THE FUCK IS LLOYD?!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHere!\u201d A voice called as the door swung open again.</p> <p>\u201cOh, speak of the plot convenience!\u201d Rosa rolled her eyes.</p> <p>Lloyd rushed in, dropping a pair of extradimensional bags on the ground before quickly straightening up.</p> <p>Lloyden was the last person Bia had invited along. His golden hair curled around his face neatly, topped with a red cap. He wore an unnaturally clean jacket that looked to be on the higher end of the quality spectrum. It was unlike him to be the last person to arrive to any given meeting, what with his constant obsession with acting professional. Must have had shitty parents or something, I dunno.</p> <p>\u201cSorry I\u2019m late,\u201d He said profusely. \u201cIt\u2019s simply the pinnacle of disappointment that I\u2019ve delayed the proceedings of this gathering. I make clear my regret in - \u201c</p> <p>Rosa grabbed one of the chairs and slammed it into his chest. It didn\u2019t hurt him - he was a tier seven adventurer like myself, and Rosa had no tier at all. He did, however, stumble back in shock.</p> <p>\u201cCan you all stop causing property damage?\u201d Dan said, though he sounded just as bored as usual.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s absolutely so very interesting,\u201d Rosalie said, ignoring her brother. \u201cAlright, thanks for the recap, Golden Boy, but we really didn\u2019t need that much.\u201d She turned to Bia. \u201cWhat\u2019re we doing again?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to Troltano,\u201d I answered, as her neck snapped around to me instead. \u201cTo hire a higher tier adventuring party to clear out whatever attacked me last night.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOh, Troltano. That\u2019s in\u2026 what, the south?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes. At the border of the Sammemmnon province. You\u2019ve graduated, you must know the local geography.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNo, I\u2019m stupid.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHey, relatable!\u201d Bia said.</p> <p>Lloyd settled down on a bar stool next to Ari and pulled out a drinking flask, warily watching the chair he\u2019d been slammed with.</p> <p>\u201cSo!\u201d Bia announced. \u201cDoes everyone have their luggage?\u201d</p> <p>A chorus of assent echoed through the room.</p> <p>\u201cRighto! Off we go then! I have the crabs ready in the lot.\u201c</p> <p>She marched right out the door.</p> <p>\u201cWhat does she mean by crabs?\u201d Rosa asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo idea, but it\u2019s probably something stupid,\u201d I replied, before following my sister outside.</p> Warning <p>Next chapter is WIP.</p>"},{"location":"Story/Short%20Stories/","title":"Short Stories","text":"<p>These stories are not locked to the main plot and serve to flesh out other elements of the world or simply random ideas I.

The Amirlithic army had lined up a contigent of ships in voidspace, observing the anomalous object - though most of the soldiers had correctly interpreted \u2018observe\u2019 as \u2018destroy\u2019. They had all been waiting for a starter\u2019s pistol that was either several hours late or not there at all. Keppelky had joined up with the expedition for action, not loitering around next to some random cube in the Void.</p> <p>The cube in question was at least somewhat interesting. Keppelky had been staring at it for most of the intervening time. The ship\u2019s sensors visualized it as a titanic object some one and a half million kilometres wide, made from an unknown metal. It drifted slowly through the metaphysical space of the Void, doing absolutely nothing. Yet of course, Amirlithic higher-ups had decided it had to be monitored.</p> <p>Just as Keppelky was considering turning around and returning to Seronveth Base, the cube on the screen shook. His eyes rapidly snapped towards the dashboard, hands flying across the panels and into ready position. He felt the ship\u2019s subtle vibration as his senses flowed into that combative zen.</p> <p>\u201cAll ships on alert!\u201d blared the General through the communications system. Thankfully, the message could travel with haste through the small metaphysical distance between the ships.</p> <p>Eyes glued to the screen, Keppelky watched as the cube\u2019s vibration stopped and a panel on it\u2019s surface retracted, revealing a pulsing blue glow.</p> <p>Each ship in the fleet also began emitting a matching light, that of a standard energy shield used on dimensional ships. From within the cube, another smaller cube emerged, bathed in the light of the energy shield. The new cube, presumably some form of dimensional vessel, stopped just away from the previous cube and exited the cube\u2019s reality. The fleet collectively swapped their displays to visualize the new proto-reality generated around the ship.</p> <p>A crackling noise spawned from the comms panel, and a new voice splintered out of it.</p> <p>\u201cGood day, Agbe-lit - nope - Amberlith-ik soldiers. I, am David Kim.\u201d</p> <p>Keppelky looked at the panel in confusion. Had the cube ship\u2026 hacked into the comms network?</p> <p>Amirlithic technology was state of the art, premium quality, military grade. Only the Architect faction surpassed them. What could possibly breach their systems?</p> <p>\u201cDavid Kim,\u201d the General\u2019s voice echoed, as Keppelky turned back to the display screen. \u201cI am going to need you and your little cube to pack up and- \u201c</p> <p>\u201cDO NOT INSULT THE COOB.\u201d</p> <p>The voice of David Kim blared out like the decree of an Immortal, seeming to transcend the dimensional barriers between the ships and rattle their hulls regardless of the petty laws of metaphysics. Keppelky heard the pipes in the hull shake as volatile aura fuel slurry sprang about in nonsensical patterns, as if stampeding away from the sound. The panels and displays of the cockpit flickered unstably.</p> <p>\u201cAs I was saying,\u201d Kim\u2019s voice reasserted itself. \u201cI am David Kim of the new corporate empire of idi0cy\u2024inc. I am here for assurances.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou - son of a - can\u2019t - \u201d the General attempted to get a few words in, but Kim seemed to have acquired priority.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I most certainly can. No profanity please, the Narrator is submitting this one to a school assignment.\u201d</p> <p>His words hung in the air. School assignment? Narrator? Keppelky thought in confusion. Whatever idi0cy\u2024inc was, they had not sent a very good negotiator. Leaning forward over the control panel, Keppelky\u2019s fingers tensed over the dials and buttons.</p> <p>\u201cAllow me to clarify. I am here to give assurances, not to get them. The Coob and the surrounding voidspace has become the territory of idi0cy\u2024inc. Attempt to revert this, and you shall suffer the wrath of the Narrator. Which you may receive regardless, as it would be funny.\u201d</p> <p>Unable to receive orders from the General, the fleet was growing increasingly tense. The tension was broken when the ship sensors detected an Amirlithic projectile transcending dimensional barriers and speeding towards the cube ship.  It hit the shield, which rippled and settled back into place. Keppelky winced, knowing that the perpetrator would likely be reprimanded.</p> <p>\u201cAnyway,\u201d Kim drawled. \u201cYou all have thirty seconds to vacate the area before the Coob blasts you to smithereens.\u201d</p> <p>None of the ships moved, until an aura blasted out from the Coob. The power within was indescribable, seeming to transcend the Void itself. Keppelky seemed to have awakened a new sense altogether as the aura shredded at his soul. His hands flashed across the control panel in natural instinct to turn the ship right around as countless of the fleet followed, fleeing from the almighty Coob, attempting to block out the sounds and sights and smells flashbanging his senses.</p> <p>He ran and ran and ran, until the rest of the fleet was no longer in comm vicinity and the Coob was long gone. He would be content to rest there in the endless Void for the rest of his days, as long as he would never see the Coob again.</p>"},{"location":"Story/Short%20Stories/Krath%27s%20Interview/","title":"Krath's Interview","text":"Info <p>For reference on what these symbols mean, see the story index</p>"},{"location":"Story/Short%20Stories/Krath%27s%20Interview/#preface","title":"Preface","text":"<p>This short story was written by my friend idiocy\u2024inc, who has contributed many ideas to the world of COA including kickstarting most of the bullshit with the fourth wall.

He turned around in his rolling chair, sat twiddling his thumbs anxiously on the polished brown desk. The numerous pieces of paperwork scattered across the desk were illuminated from the neon cyan-like colour emanating from a screen hovering on the desk. Aside from the cat memes and eons of TOS agreements on the screen, a pop up window sat at the very front layer of the screen. Across the screen sprawled in English, wrote the words \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t like to initiate the interview process?\u201d There were four buttons on the screen, the rest in the 4th dimension, bouncing around and phasing into each other. They read yes, no, yea, nah, sure, no yeah, yeah no, yay, all of the above, none of the below, 5 random options, one month subscription to crunchyroll, and a button for activating a 3 time use prayer account for 20 bucks.</p> <p>Krath furrowed his eyebrows in a slight confusion at the prompts flying across the screen. Of course, he had trained for situations like this. \u201cI\u2019ve used the interconnection cube before, this is no big issue.\u201d He thought, before starting to eliminate the wrong answers. Crunchyroll was clearly a scam. He wouldn\u2019t be paying any megachurch pastors anytime soon. Yes could be interpreted wrong, same as for no, and both yea and nah were discontinued after the 1324 incident. All of the above was clearly a conspiracy started by the Jarnu tech company, 5 random options was too uncertain, so that only left none of the below left. With a confident smirk on his face, Krath locked onto the button and gave it a press.</p> <p>\u201cUser response received. We will take that as a no.\u201d The screen replied in a cold robotic voice, as Krath set his elbow on the table, pinched his nose bridge and took a deep breath.</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d Krath said, his smirk evaporating faster than his bank account.</p> <p>Krath bought another screen, using up the last of his dwindling funds. He knew that his only escape from his dire situation was to go somewhere where his debt was abolished, and somewhere where no one had any jurisdiction over him. Taking the plunge, he opened up the screen again. He got through all the distracting pop ups and scams in the way, and got back to the screen. It was written in Spanish.</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p> <p>Krath overdrew his credit card, activating another screen. He had a translator with him, so that he wouldn\u2019t get screwed over by Spanish options again. He clicked all of the above.</p> <p>\u201cFuck.\u201d</p> <p>Krath clicked yea.</p> <p>\u201cSon of a bitch.\u201d</p> <p>Krath clicked, no, and then yes, and then no yeah, and all the options with variations of no and yes.</p> <p>\u201cPiece of sh-\u201d</p> <p>Krath failed a quicktime event before getting to the screen.</p> <p>\u201cMotherfu-\u201d</p> <p>Krath got a one month crunchyroll subscription.</p> <p>\u201cThis anime sucks a-\u201d</p> <p>Krath read the fine print.</p> <p>\u201cOh what the f- There is a\u2026one in \u2026 27 chance your interview will be accepted upon hitting the 5 r- sigh, shiiiiiii-\u201d</p> <p>Krath now owes more money than is currently in circulation, and then the interview finally started. Krath had a relieved, but also absolutely infuriated look on his face. His desk was practically broken in half, his room in complete disarray. A countdown timer started on the screen, starting from five and ticking down by one every second. As the display struck zero, Krath felt everything possible for a split second, before being transported into a room where he could barely fit. The walls were of a seamless chrome texture. Light seemingly coming from nowhere bounced off the walls. It was almost hard to look at, the strange arrays of light taking a toll on Krath\u2019s sight. There was a small window, placed in a way that made the room seem like solitary confinement. On the window was a coloured pencil drawing of a meadow, with a sun and clouds and a really weird animal that Krath couldn\u2019t make sense of.</p> <p>The box made a loud whirring noise, light bleeding through the paper blocking the window. The box around him unfolded out of existence leaving behind the drawing, and opened into what looked like an interrogation room. The walls were grey, looking like they were built out of aluminum sheets. On one side of the room was a window with writing on it on the other side, reading \u201cNTE: fix the one sided mirror, it's on the wrong side :(.\u201d It was strange, with words being misspelled and barely intelligible through the shotty handwriting. There were also a couple of people on the other side of the window. Krath turned his attention to the woman seated down at the other side of the table, who motioned for him to sit down.</p> <p>Krath took his seat. The chair was completely flat and made of metal, which was incredibly uncomfortable to sit in. The woman on the other side of the table was very clearly tired, struggling to keep his eyes open. Despite this, she was staring rather intensely at Krath. Both of them sat there for what felt like hours. Each passing second Krath was feeling more and more unease. Thankfully, the woman at the other side of the table was first to break the silence, turning around at the window before doing so.</p> <p>\u201cWhen do I start the interview? I have been waiting here for about 15 minutes.\u201d The woman said in a clearly frustrated voice towards the two people in the other room.</p> <p>\u201cWait, the guy is here already?\u201d One of the employees said, pausing his game of chess with the other employee.</p> <p>\u201cYes. You know when I started going here as an intern I thought I would be doing some sick ass science shit, and this is a real downgrade.\u201d The intern said back to the people in the window.</p> <p>\u201cHey hey hey, we told you that we can\u2019t see through this mirror because it's on the wrong side, okay?\u201d The other employee said.</p> <p>Krath sat as the three argued about what was going on. There were a lot of insults thrown, a lot of threats of firing, and a lot of incompetency. After a little while, they were finally able to get things going.</p> <p>\u201cAlrighty, time for one of the hardest brain teasers we have ever come up with. How many parallel sides does a cube have?\u201d The woman said, in a sort of relieved voice.</p> <p>\u201cAha! Trick question! -4!\u201d Krath said in an energetic voice like he had just out played the system.</p> <p>\u201cIt's three.\u201d The interviewer says in a monotone voice.</p> <p>\u201cShit.\u201d Krath says, before slouching back into his chair as an awkward silence struck the room.</p> <p>\u201cMoving on. Wh-\u201d The intern says before being cut off by the speaker system.</p> <p>\u201cHey uhh, Krath, do you know if you could find me a mate in 3 from this position? It's my turn right now.\u201d One of the employees asked, while holding up a magnetic chessboard to the window.</p> <p>\u201cOh uhhh, see that there horse?\u201d Krath said, pointing vaguely in that direction.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t see through the mirror.\u201d The employee responded through the speaker.</p> <p>\u201cAh, right. The white one on the black square, just shank it with that bishop, and that's a discovered check. And I think you can see where this is, yknow,\u201d Krath said, stuttering slightly at the unexpected prompt.</p> <p>\u201cYea, the queen is in prime position. Try kicking my ass now Jared.\u201d The employee said, pulling the chess board back and playing the moves.</p> <p>\u201cI really don\u2019t get paid enough for this.\u201d Said the other employee in a way that suggests this has happened before.</p> <p>\u201cOh, yea, and intern dude. You can let the guy pass, he has my approval.\u201d</p> <p>With a disappointed look on her face, the intern raises his hand. Suddenly, a non-euclidean horror begins to manifest 2 centimeters away from her palm. The intern starts to slowly chant something, while incantations, dodecahedrons, penrose triangles and most importantly bullshit starts to gather. The shadowy form of a remote can be seen, and soon the disruption in physics and metaphysics collapses into a fully formed remote. Krath is bewildered, while the intern has an incredibly stern expression on her face. The intern then presses the button on the remote.</p> <p>\u201cAlrighty, you can go to the next room.\u201d The intern says not looking at where the door should be.</p> <p>\u201cWhere\u2026 exactly?\u201d Krath asks</p> <p>\u201cOh fu- did it not wo- the intern looks around her-yeah, no it didn\u2019t. I swear I kept a fresh pack of double A\u2019s on me, batteries not included my ass.\u201d The intern says, fumbling around her coat pockets presumably trying to find double A batteries.</p> <p>\u201cAha! There it fucking is. Let's go. Now how the hell do these fit? Ah. there\u2026 Really? Nothing? God, they write these symbols like madmen.\u201d The intern said while fiddling with the battery alignment.</p> <p>\u201cI think those need to go diagonally across each other.\u201d Krath said.</p> <p>\u201cNo, of course not. They wouldn\u2019t design this bullshit to become a parralelogr- oh wait. That kinda makes sense. Is this why I don\u2019t get paid?\u201d The intern says before clicking the button.</p> <p>This time a door opens out of the wall, and Krath walks through it. He pauses slightly, about to say something, but disregards it as everyone in the room seems to have occupied themselves by now. The door opens to an endless open white void, with the frame repeating through it with a gleam like its bad CGI. Without further ado, Krath took a step in. Krath suddenly felt a zooming sensation, before being transported to an endless black void. The only thing he could see was the floor, a slightly gleaming plane that propagated till what seemed to be infinity. The only thing visible now was a man of tall stature in a tuxedo that was definitely of higher quality than Krath\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cHello there my dear lost traveler! Welcome to the void, where your dreams die and your nightmares feed off of the corpses. I am your host, Baruch, and I will be guiding you through eternity in nothing.\u201d The well dressed man says in a shrill game show-like voice that rips through the empty atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a bloody TREE(3) since I met another visitor. So let me guide you through this illogical hellscape!\u201d The man says, voice cascading through nothing like thunder as non-euclidean geometry flocks throughout the world, accompanied by epic music.</p> <p>\u201cNow, care to give an intro-\u201d The man says while turning around. \u201c-Oh fuck its one of you people.\u201d He says, fingers pinching his nose bridge, clearly frustrated as the non-euclidean wonders and epic music slouched back like a sad dog.</p> <p>\u201cIs t-this, not, the interview?\u201d Krath says as the music turns off.</p> <p>\u201cNo. It isn\u2019t. You\u2019re in the wrong cosmology you idiot. Y\u2019know, in my dimension, I am the coolest fucking guy, I\u2019m like a god. I am the host of the void, which isn\u2019t original, but it sure is fucking, cool. Do you know how catchy that song was? And how much better my suit is in comparison to yours? But god ever since you idiot whatevers started showing up I just turn into a gag character.\u201d The man says, clearly very frustrated.</p> <p>\u201cSorry, I guess?\u201d Krath replies, not really sure of what to make of the situation.</p> <p>\u201cYou better be. I spent an eternity making these cool non-euclidean polygon architectures for the next visitor, and now it seems lame as shit.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt is some pretty cool geometry.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI, know. So please get out, and go tell those fuckers to quit messing, with a superior, storyline.\u201d</p> <p>Baruch walked up to Krath, and slapped him so hard he got sent to another interview room. His head still moved in the way one would expect after being slapped, and he held his hand against the part of his head that made contact. This time the room seemed more friendly, with a table, rolling chair and a whiteboard on one of the walls. There was an interviewer with a buttoned up shirt that was only half tucked in next to the table, pacing around, before noticing his entrance and greeting him.</p> <p>\u201cHey there!\u201d He said in an enthusiastic tone.</p> <p>\u201cGreetings.\u201d Krath said back, shaking his hand.</p> <p>\u201cSalutations my good sir-\u201d The interviewer said, mocking him. \u201cAnyways, you met the void edgelord guy right? The one called barbados or something.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah, Baruch. He was pretty pissed.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes-\u201d The interviewer said, pumping his fist. \u201cYou can take a seat, and this whole interview is sort of just a formality. No need to worry at all. First question, who is our lord and savior?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe concept of a cube?\u201d Krath said, kind of expecting it.</p> <p>\u201cHell yeah! This narrator is obsessed with those things. Can\u2019t really express it anywhere else without it being a plot hole so, he has to make it our whole thing, which I am a-okay with. Checkmark there. Now onto question two. Who do you like?\u201d The interviewer said, leaning in, putting more intensity into the atmosphere.</p> <p>\u201cWh-what do you mean by like? I am literally new to the office, so I guess no one\u2026?\u201d Krath said, incredibly confused by the line of questioning from the interview.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever sounds believable, I\u2019ll note that down. I like the options you're giving me for office gossip. Alrighty, moving on. What is the answer to the universe, life, narrative plane, and everything?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt's definitely 42.\u201d Krath said confidently.</p> <p>\u201cWelp. That\u2019s all I need to know, it's not like they keep me here for quality control.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cReally? Isn\u2019t that the purpose of an interview?\u201d Krath said, puzzled.</p> <p>\u201cNope. The purpose is so that I can get paid extra!\u201d The employee said back at him like the answer should be obvious.</p> <p>\u201cWhere do I go now?\u201d Krath asked.</p> <p>\u201cDown the hall, on the door to the left that says ethics committee evaluation office.\u201d The employee said casually while rolling around on his chair.</p> <p>\u201cYou guys actually have a place for ethics.\u201d Krath asked in a slightly surprised tone.</p> <p>\u201cSurprisingly, yes. How much do they actually do? Let me ask you a question. How many ethics committee members does it take to screw in a lightbulb?\u201d The interviewer said, no longer rolling around in his chair and pointing his pen in the direction of Krath inquisitively.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. One? Half a step ladder?\u201d Krath said back.</p> <p>\u201cNone! The ethics committee can\u2019t change anything!\u201d The employee said, laughing hysterically afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cHahaha, well uhh, I\u2019ll be on my way now.\u201d Krath said, trying to laugh along with the employee before walking out the door.</p> <p>As he stepped through the frame, he braced for impact, squinting his eyes. He felt nothing. As he opened his eyes, he realized that it was a normal door. Upon further inspection, he noticed that there wasn\u2019t a door in the frame at all, and that it was in queue for another door. As he scanned the hall, it seemed to be an endless expanse with doors on both sides of the hallway. Some of the doors were open, presumably waiting for a door to become available, and he could peer through them. Through the hall he could see jail complexes, voids, warehouses, all not seeming to fit the geometry of the hallway. As he looked to the left, he found the ethics committee evaluation office. As Krath put his hand on the knob the door disappeared, queuing for another one. In the office there was a roundtable with a woman sitting there.</p> <p>\u201cHello there Krath, take a seat.\u201d The woman said in an ominous voice, as the roundtable was dimly lit.</p> <p>\u201cRight.\u201d Krath said as he pulled out the chair and sat on it.</p> <p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t have a last name? It's fine. The narrator writing this hardly gave me a first name. However, that is besides the point. Do you know how much outreach this committee has?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot to be disrespectful, but given the work conditions, I would assume none.\u201d Krath replied, trying not to come off as disrespectful.</p> <p>\u201cThat is what most people think, there are also a lot of jokes about it. How many ethics committee members does it take to screw in a lightbulb?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNone? I'm guessing the punchline is that the ethics committee can\u2019t change anything.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe guy with the half tucked in shirt told you that one already now didn\u2019t he?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe definitely did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cRight. Anyways, we do a lot of work to give the impression that we are useless here. However, we are the secret power in this company. You see, our outreach is secretle-\u201d The woman said until the lights turned on. \u201c-God did you turn on the lights? I was trying to be all mysterious and cool okay. We almost had him too, weren\u2019t you the one who wanted someone else to play UNO with us?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cLook here, unnamed friend, if it wasn\u2019t the lights that broke the vibe it would have been my unending laughter. Seeing you trying to convince that intern that we actually do things in here while blatantly copying the ethics committee orientation from the SCP wiki is just sad.\u201d Another woman said, presumably the one who turned on the lights.</p> <p>\u201cWait, what do you guys actually do?\u201d Krath said, more confused now.</p> <p>\u201cWe just get to see whatever projects are happening in our branch and approve them. Last time,  we approved for someone who vaporized a dimension to find his missing sock. Billions dead, likely including the sock because he never found it.\u201d The woman sat at the table said.</p> <p>\u201cOkay. How do I pass this interview, because right now that is really all I care about.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t really do anything. We\u2019ve been scanning your brain and we\u2019re gonna watch a movie of it together and judge your life decisions for like, ethics and all that. In fact we already have. That's what the weird box you were put in was for. How did you manage to go broke buying stocks?\u201d The woman at the counter grabbing a cereal box said.</p> <p>\u201cHey, I was buying at the dip okay. Also don\u2019t judge my financial abilities.\u201d Krath said in an aggressively defensive manner.</p> <p>\u201cRiiiiiight. Anyways, the least ethical thing you did was having a major labour complex in your basement, but we have 3 next door so I don\u2019t see how that\u2019s a problem. Approved. You can go to the guy at the top now. You\u2019re gonna have to take the stairs though.\u201d The woman at the table said, as an entrance to a staircase opened up out of the walls.</p> <p>\u201cHow many stairs are there?\u201d Krath asked.</p> <p>\u201c9,223,372,036,854,775,807 steps.\u201d The employee responded.</p> <p>\u201cIs there any faster way up? Y\u2019know, other than climbing the 64 bit integer limit?\u201d Krath asked, trying to be hopeful about his options.</p> <p>\u201cYou could sell me your soul for a shortcut. Here\u2019s the contract, sign here.\u201d The employee at the table says, tapping on an empty signature box.</p> <p>\u201cSure, whatever. At this point I have nothing to lose.\u201d Krath said, while signing the document.</p> <p>\u201cReally? You folded that easily?\u201d The employee asked.</p> <p>\u201cYes really. That\u2019s because I have infused 10 souls into my body, which means you only own 10% equity in my total soul assets. Now what\u2019s the shortcut?\u201d Krath said rather confidently</p> <p>\u201cCan\u2019t say that's the first time it's happened. Oh well, anyways. Go through the other door.\u201d The woman said in a casual way, as once another entrance opened up, this time to a much shorter staircase.</p> <p>Despite that, it was still a rather long staircase. Fortunately, the gravity inside of the room had apparently been turned off, allowing for easier travel. Krath jumped as hard as he could, and hit the roof. Trying once again, Krath actually managed to get a working trajectory. The stairs appeared to blur as he was going rather quickly through the hall. Slowly, he could see the door at the end come closer and closer to him. Eventually, he made it to the top, hitting his head against the door in the same place he had hit it in the first attempt. Upon his head coming into contact with the door, it disappeared, letting him fly through. In the room gravity returned, and he fell to the ground.</p> <p>\u201cKrath, is it? Get over here.\u201d A man in a suit said, standing next to a bar stool.</p> <p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d Krath said, making his way to the bar in what seemed to be a mansion.</p> <p>\u201cAll that will be answered. First, what do you know about this company? What do we actually do?\u201d The man said while walking into the bar.</p> <p>\u201cI'm not really sure, to be honest.\u201d</p> <p>The man chuckled to himself a bit.</p> <p>\u201cWell, how about another question. You know about pataphysics right?\u201d The man said, Krath nodding to his question.</p> <p>\u201cWell all the theories are true. We are in a narrative stack, and there is a narrator to this universe. On technical terms, we\u2019re a massive narrative anomaly. In more understandable words, we are a massive plot hole, designed specifically for shits and giggles. Hell, this whole interview was a gag. The only reason we are where we are, is because we are favoured by the narrator. Let that sink in for a bit.\u201d He said, grabbing two fancy glasses and a bottle of liquor from the bar.</p> <p>\u201cHow reassuring.\u201d Krath said in a sarcastic voice.</p> <p>\u201cWell I don\u2019t work here to reassure. Anyways, I\u2019m the administrator. I am this company.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDo you mean you own this company?\u201d Krath asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo. I am quite literally the company itself, I am the reason it is here. My real name is Kayden, and I am literally on the same narrative plane as the narrator. Don\u2019t get confused, I don\u2019t narrate. I\u2019m just some guy who is acquainted with the narrator. Notice how I didn\u2019t say friend there. He\u2019s not familiar with those. Anyways I managed to bullshit this gag into existence, you'd better be thankful. This brings us to what you are going to do. We need to maintain the favor of the narrator, if we get too boring or not fun enough we\u2019re either going to get deleted, or even worse, discontinued.\u201d The administrator had just finished pouring the liquor into the glasses, on the rocks, and started walking back to the seat where he once was.</p> <p>\u201cI have many questions, but I have some strange feeling they aren\u2019t going to get answered.\u201d Krath said.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d be right about that. One thing I can answer is that you are hired.\u201d The administrator said, while Krath was sloshing his drink around slightly.</p> <p>\u201cOkay, what do I do?\u201d Krath asked, slightly excited but evidently trying to hide it.</p> <p>\u201cYour lifelong career job will be to find anyone developing or using AI, and stop them. By AI I mean the techbro chatgpt kind, and by stop I will usually mean stab.\u201d The administrator said, grabbing his drink and taking a seat.</p> <p>\u201cWhy exactly?\u201d Krath asked.</p> <p>\u201cWell we wouldn\u2019t want the narrator to think that we support something that could take his future job now would we?\u201d The administrator asked.</p> <p>\u201cNo wonder the interview start button was so damn annoying.\u201d Krath said, making a joke about the state of the company\u2019s infrastructure.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re right about that.\u201d</p> <p>The administrator raised his glass, and Krath followed.</p> <p>\u201cIn the favour of god.\u201d The administrator said.</p> <p>\u201cIn the favour of god.\u201d Krath affirmed.</p> <p>A glass clink can be felt throughout idi0cy\u2024inc voidspace.</p>"},{"location":"Story/Short%20Stories/The%20Great%20Inventor/","title":"The Great Inventor","text":"Info <p>For reference on what these symbols mean, see the story index</p> <p>In the darkness, there was a piece of rock. It was rectangular and flat, and a few thousand kilometres thick. On its surface were thousands of tubelike structures, strung up between cylindrical towers that pushed up against the world\u2019s ceiling. Six-limbed citizens crawled across their surfaces, entering through various arched holes to do their business.</p> <p>Within a cluster of a thousand such towers, there lived the Great Inventor. He was alone in his tower, and nobody bothered him. The man slaved away at his workbench, drawing plans and carving sigils and assembling machines. He\u2019d modified his own body to not require sleep. Every fibre of his life was dedicated to his gray creation.</p> <p>Days pass. The Inventor pulled wires, etched circuits and welded metal. The cacophony echoed through the city\u2019s great towers, like a ghost bashing away at a wall, begging to be heard. The Inventor drags many parts into the chamber: metal, wood, fabric, flesh. His machine grows day by day, soon occupying most of the massive chamber. Its hulking form curled up one wall in ribbons and clumps of material, looming over the Inventor as he hammered against its surface.</p> <p>Finally, after years of toil, the Inventor sits down on an empty wooden crate. He cranes his head up and admires his creation. It stands there, motionless. Two chains hang from within the bowels of the machine, and strung up between them is a faceless automaton. The Inventor stares at the empty body, thinks, grins. He lifts a hand and snaps a bony finger.</p> <p>The machine rumbles.</p> <p>Finally, thinks the Inventor, will all those wrongs be righted. The unjustly slain will walk this land again, and then I will no longer need to fear. All those I watched, bones and husks, will no longer need to fear. There is no longer anything to fear.</p> <p>The Inventor shifts his weight, then stands. Anticipation is wild in his eyes, laser focused on the automaton. And as if in reaction to his gaze, the automaton moves. It jerks, once, twice, falls to the ground. The Inventor cackles with joy!</p> <p>And so be it! exclaims the Inventor. It is done. I have laughed in the face of the Immortals, laughed in the face of death itself, the great tragedy! You are no longer welcome in this world!</p> <p>He was so ecstatic and triumphant, but in reality ignorant. For, he wasn\u2019t the only one cackling. He would never ascertain the source of this other laughter. He would never see this realm again.</p>"},{"location":"Story/Writing%20Snippets/","title":"Writing Snippets","text":"<p>These are small parts of the mainline story that I wrote ahead of time because I was too excited to wait.
